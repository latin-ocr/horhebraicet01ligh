358 C'lzoroympkical inquiry.

J osh. v, when this which Moses speaks of is really Galilee3
as I have proved elsewhere.

On these two mounts (it is well known) were pronounced
the blessings and the curses‚ Deut. xi. 29, and xxvii. 12, 133
J osh. viii. 33. But mark the impudence of the Samaritam,
who, in their text, Deut. xxvii. 4, instead of “ Ye shall set

up these stones which I command you this day 1733? nvn on
mount Ebal,” they have put “Ye shall set up these stenes, Sco.
ΞἾῙἾἾΠ ἾΠΞ, οη mount Gerizim.''

Compare, with this falsification of theim, that in Sotah k,
“ R. Eliezer Ben J ose saith, Ihave said to yon, Ο Samaritam,
Ye have falsified your law; for ye say, 0:12⁷ ΠἾἾὈ ’3Ἰίἳᾶ tlte
plain qf Moreleff, ἰυῘιίοῘι is Slceclaem, Dent. xi. 30 [they add She-
chem of their own] : we ourselves indeed confess that the plain
of Moreh is Shechem,” Suc.

Seeing he blames the Samaritans for falsifiying their text
in so little a matter, wherein the truth is not injured, namely,
in adding Shechem, why did he not object to them that
greaterl fault of snborning Gerizim for mount Ebal. The
truth is, this very thing giveth me reason enough to suspect
that this bold and wicked interpolation of the word Gerizim
for Ehal hath stolen into the Samaritan text since the time
that this Rabbin wrote. The thing is not unworthy our con-
sidcring.

SECT. IV.— lVleys it is written δμώων, ancl not Sychem.

Ir Sychem and Sychar be one and the same city, why
should not the name be the same?

L This may happen from the common dialect, wherein it
is very usual to change the letters. So Reuben in the Syriae

version is Reubil, and Ῥούβηλος, Iffzcbelzes, in -Josephus ς by what
⁸ etymology let him tell, and explain it if yon can. Speaking
of Leah bringing forth Renben, he thus expresseth himself ἠς
