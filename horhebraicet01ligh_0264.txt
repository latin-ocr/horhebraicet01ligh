SEcr. II.—Seytlzopolis‚ loeretofore ζέήὶἶ.) w: Beth-shean,

one of the Decapolitana citios.

THE Talmudists very frequently propound the particular
example of the city Beth-shean‚ which is also called Scytho· *
polis, (see the LXX in Judg. i. 27), and do always resolve it
to stand in a different condition from the other cities of the
land of Israel.

“ Rabbie (say they) looseth Beth-shean‚ Rabbi looseth
Oaesarea, Rabbi looseth Beth Gubrin, Rabbi looseth Caphar
Tsemach from the Demai;'' that is, from the tithing of things
doubtful. Jarchi citing these words addeth these moreover;
“Ford all those places were like to Beth-show, which the
Israelites subdued coming up out of Egypt; but they subdued
it not when they came out of Babylon.''

“ R. Meire (say they) ate the leaves of herbs [not tithed]
in Beth-shean, and thenceforth Rabbi Meir loosed all Beth-
shean from tithing.’' Upon which story thus Jarchi again;
“ R. Meri ate leaves in Beth-'shean not tithed, because tithing
is not used out of the land of Israel.” Note this well, I pra-5¹5
that Beth-sheau, which plainly was within the land of Israel,
yet is reckoned for a city which is out of the land of Israel,
and for a heathen city: and the reason is given, because, al-
though it were within the land, and came into the possession
of the Israelites in the first· conquest of it, yet it came not
into their possession in their second conquest, but was always
inhabited by heathens. The same, with good grounds, we
judge of the rest of the cities of Decapohs, which were indeed
within the limits of Israelitic land, but which the Syrians
or heathens had usurped, and until then possessed. After
we have numbered some of those cities, the thing will appear
the moro clearly.

But if you ask, by the way, who the inhabitants of Beth-
shcan were when the Jews camo up out of Babylon; and
who would not, could not be subdued by the Jews, is a matter
of more obscure search: you would guess thom to be Scy-
thians from the derivation of the word, and from the words
of Pliny: ‘⁶ Scythopolis, heretoforc Nysa, froin Scythians
