The northern coast of Judea. Beth-horon.

Tms coast is marked out J 0811. xviii. 12 3 where, at ver. 14,
are very many versions to be corrected, which render Εἰ the
seem such are, the Syriae, the Seventy, the Vulgar, the
Italian, curs, &c.: whence ariseth a sense of insuperable
difficulty to a chorographical eye: when it should, indeed,

be rendered of the west, as the Chaldee, Arabio, R. Solomon,

We read of a double Beth-horon in the Old Testament‚
but one only under the second Temple. This in Josephuss
is Βαιθωρὼ, and, according to him t, stood a hundred fur-
longs, or themabouts, from J erusalem,—viz. twelve miles and
a half.

At that place that great Oanaanitish army perished, J osh.
x. not with hail ( the Jews being judges), which presently
melted,—but with stenes, which hardened, and lasted unto
all following ages. Hence is that, “ Whosoeveru shall 800
the place, where the Israelites passed through the sea, where
they passed through Jordan, where they passed by the rivers
of Arnon, or those great stenes (zv-7³35& Ἶῑὶκὶ), in the going
down of Beth-horon,—-is bound to bless.''

They believe, in the sanie place, also, the army of Senna-
cherib fell. For so the Gloss upon the words before spoken,
‘⁶ The “ going down of Beth-horon was the place where the
army of Sennacherib fell.”

This was a highway. Josephus, in the place above cited,
relating a story of one Stephen‚ a servant of Caesar, who
suffered hardly by robbers in this place, saith, that it was
κατὰ τὴν Βαιθωρὼ δημοσίαν ὁδὸν, “in the public way of Beth-
horon ,·''—na1nely, in the king's highway‚ which goes from
Jerusalem to Caesarea.

Yet the passage and ascent here was very strait3 which·
the Talmudists (10 thus describe: “ If y two camels go up
together in the ascent of Beth-horon, both fallss’ The Gloss,
