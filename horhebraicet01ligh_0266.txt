SECT. IV.—Pella‚ α city of Decapolis.

ΡιιΝΥ numbers Pella also among the Decapolitan cities:
and so also doth Epiphaniusk: and that it was of the same
condition under which, we suppose, the other Decapolitan
cities were put, namely, that it was inhabited by heathens,
the words of Josephus make plain: “ Thel Jews recovered
these cities of the Moabites from the enemy, Essebon, Me-
daba, Lemba, Oronas, Telithon, Zara, Cilicium Aulon, Pella.
Ταύτην δὲ κατέσκαψαν, &Q But this (Pella) they overthrew‚
because the inhabitants would not endure to be brought over
unto the customs of the country.'' Behold the citizens of
Pella vigorously heathen, so that their city underwent a kind
of martyrdom, if 1 may so call it, for retaining their hea-
thenism. And when it was restored under Pompey, it was
rendered back to the same citizensm‚ the same Josephus
bearing witnessn.

But take heed, reader, that his words do not deceive you
concerning its situation3 who writes thus of Perea, Μῆκος μὲν
αὐτῆς ἀπὸ Μαχαιροῦντος εἰς Πέλλαν, “ Τ110υ length of Perea is
from Macherus to Pella, and the northern coasts are bounded
at Pella :'’ that is, of Perea, as distinct from Trachonitis aud
Batanea. For l‘ella was the furthest northern coast of
Perea, and the south coast of Trachonitis. Hence Josephus
reckons and ranks it together with Hippo, Dio, Scythopolis,
111 the place before cited Ρ.

There is no need to name more cities of Decapolis beyond
Jordan ; these things which have been said make sufficiently
for our opinion, both concerning the situation of the places,
and the nature of thom. Let us only add this, while we are
conversant beyond Jordan, and about Pella: “ Ammon and
Moab (say the Gemaristsq) tithe the tithe of the poor in the
seventh year, ’² &a Where the Gloss thus; “ Ammon and
Moab are Israelites who dwell in the land of Ammon and
Moab, which Moses took from sichon. And that land was
holy, according to the holiness of the land of lsrael: but
