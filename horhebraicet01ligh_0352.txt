Smer. L—(Jertaz'n memes and places ofnem· soemtl
willa Σαλεὶμ, ⁶ Sabim)

Lm us begin with Σαλεὶμ, Sabim, and thence look aster its
neighbour ‘AEnon.’ We may be a little helped in our inquiry
by that passage in Genesis xxxiii. 18 : '5527 0371? :lp-37] &5222
02& “ And came to Shalem, a city of Syehem.” There are
soine versione, and the authors of the tames, have upon these
words built I know not what city Salem near Sychem. But
neither the Jews nor Samaritans acknowledge any such thing.
For the Jews render it, and that not without reason, “ And
Jacob came safe into the city of Sheclien1.” 'rhet Samaritan
text hath D'il'lw, instead of 0³7⁸& ‘⁶ he came in peace :⁹³ and
certainly there is no part of mankind could be more likely to
judge than the Samari tans, whether DlNU, inphat place, were
the name of any city, yea or no.

II. Σαλεὶμ, Sabim, in the Greek interpreter, according to the '

Roman copy is ,the name osa place, J osh. xix. 22 ; where the
Hebrew runs thuswnv ΠᾞῚΊ ΠῩΤΞἾΞΠΨἾ ἾἾΞΠΤᾏ ‘7³:311 2⁷32*
“ And the coast [fflssseaclaar] reacheth to Tabor, ancl Shaha-
zimah, and Beth·shemesh.” But the Greek, Καὶ συνάψει τὰ
ὅρια ἐπὶ Γαιθβὼρ, καὶ ἐπὶ Σαλὶμ κατὰ Θάλασσαν, καὶ Βαιθσα·
μώς· “ And the confines touched upon Gethbor‚ and upon*
Salim near the sea, and Bethsamosh.”

The Masorets observe that- Shahazimah, which is written
with a Vau [Ἶ], should be written by a dod [']; which also
these interpreters acknowledge (which is worthy our taking
notice of); but then they divide the word into two parts and
write it ΠῺἾ 'Vl-¹³²⁷ i. e. Shahaz, κατὰ θάλασσαν, Shahaz at the
sea: but why they should turn Shalcaz into Salina, it is some-
thing difficult to guess.

It seems probable that Σελάμη, arlanza, which Joseph11su‚
in the account of his own life, makes mention of, as fortified
by himself, amongst other towns in Galilee, is the same with
this Σαλὶμ, Salina mentioned by the Sevonty3 and that the
rather, because there it is reckonesl up with mount Tabnr.

Ill. Σααλεὶμ, baalim, in the Alexandrian copy, answers to

t Onkelos. Jonatlmn, llercshith Rabba, sect. 71). Schab. sol. 33, 2, &c.
