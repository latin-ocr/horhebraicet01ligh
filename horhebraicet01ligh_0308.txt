does not sit in the shadow of his tabernacle beyond twenty

or cover of his tabernacle be above twenty cubits high}
‘⁴ Abai saith unto him, If, therefore, any onen shall pitch a
tabernacle in Ashtaroth-karnaim, is not the tabernacle so
also?'⁷ Gloss: ‘⁶ Ashtaroth-karnaim were two great moun-
tains, with a valley between; and, by reason of the height
and shadow of those mountains, the sun never shone upon
the valley.”

Why the Samaritan copy should use here ΠἾἾῘ) ΠὌἚὩ
Aphinitlz Karnaialc, instead of ‘ Ashtaroth-karnaim,’ espe-
cially when it retains the word Ashtaroth elsewhere, is not
easy to say, unless it should have some relation to Γῦν
ὀοίιρῖιεῑ as a place thick and shady with boughs. But such

That the Zuzims inhabited Pe'rea, as it is distinguished
from the country of Bashan, may be evident from the pro-
gress of the conqueror; for whereas it is plain that the Re-
phaims dwelt in Bashan, and the Emims in the country of
Moab, Deut. ii. 10, Π, it is manifest that the Zuzims, who

were amongst the Rephaims, when they were distinguished
both in nation and dwelling. The Samaritan, we may be suro,
took 0¹33 for no other than a place, when it renders Nw'·l71
in Lislzala'.

When the Israelites went out of Egypt into that land, the
whole Transjordanine region was divided into these two
seigniories,—the kingdom of Schon, and the kingdom of Og.
That of Sehon was Perea, strictly so called nowz that of
Og, was all the rest under the name of Bashan. But after
the return of Israel from Babylon, Bashan was so subdivided,
that Batanea, or Bashan, was only a part of it, the rest going
under the name of Trachonitis, Auranitis, and, if you will,
