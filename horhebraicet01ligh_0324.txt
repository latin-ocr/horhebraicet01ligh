πηγὴ γραμμάτων, α fountaz'n of letters, J osh. xxi. 29, let those
that are more learned, search out. It is true, the children
of Issachar are celebrated for their skill in computing the
times, 1 Chron. xii. 32; where the Targumist‚ “ They were
skilled in calculating the beginnings of the years, the calends
of the months, and the intercalation both of years and months3

If we would include the LeviteS, that dwelt amongst the
tribe of lssaohar, under the general name of Issachar, then
might, Engannim, being a Levitical city, be an aeademy for
that kind of mathematica] learning; but in both we are very
uncertain. Nor is it less obscure, that the same Greek in-
terpreter hath, instead of Remeth, Engannim (1, Enhaddah,
and Bethpazes, rendered, Ῥεμμᾶς, καὶ Ἰεὼυ, καὶ Τομμὰυ, καὶ
Αἷμαρὲκ, καὶ Βηρσάφης· “ Remmas, and ιῙεοη, and Tommcm,

W E have spoken something already concerning Emmaus
in our Chorographical Century, chap. xlv, let us add some
few things in this place.

I. It was distant from Jerusalem, as appears both from
our evangelist and Josepl1usr, about threescore fui-longs.
By account of common furlongs, seven miles and a half,
eight of the Jewish. What COpy, therefore, of Josephus must
the learned Beza have by him, who thus speaks upon the
place? Ἑξήκοντα, “ sixty3 so the Syriae hath it, and indeed
all copies : so that here is either a mistake in the number, or
else it is ill written in Josephus, thirty furlongs.” Our ‚Jo-
sephus plainly hath it, χώριου ὃ καλεῖται μὲν Ἀμμαοὺς ἀπέχει
δὲ τῶν Ἱεροσολύμων σταδίους ἑξήκοντα· “ Λ town called Em-
maus, distant from ‚Ierusalem threesoore furlo11gs.”
