lee East Gate of the Court. 69

The Levites ⁰, with harps, lyres, cymbals, trumpets‚ and in-
finite other musical instrumenta stood upon the fifteen steps
going down out of the Court of Israel into the Women's
court, singing according to the number of the fifteen psalms
of degreeS, &c.

The east gate of the Court of Israel was called the “ gate
of Nicanor.''——-“ Allp the gates were changed to be of gold,
except the gate of Nicanor 3 because concerning that a mi-
racle was shown: others say, because the brass of it did ex-
ceedingly shine.''

Inq the gate of Nicanor, they made the suspected wife
drink the bitter waters ; they purified *the woman after child-
birth, and the leper.

Of the miracle‚ done about the folding-doors of this gate,
see Constantine L'Empereur‚ Middoth, p. 57, and J uchasin,
fol. 65. 2, &c.; who also produceth another reason of the
name, in these words : “ In the book of Josephus Ben Gorion
it is said, that the gate of Nicanorr was so called, because a
miracle was' there shown, namely, that there they slew N ica-
nor, a captain of the Grecians, in the days of the Asmoneans ε
which may also be seen in the end of the second chapter of
the tract Taanith.”

The history alleged is thus z—NicanorS was one of the
captains of the Greeks; and every day he wagged his hand
towards J udea and Jerusalem, and said, “ Oh l when will it
be in my power, to lay them waste 1²³ But when the As-
monean family prevailed‚ they subdued them, and slew
him, and hung up his thumbs and great toes upon the gates
of Jerusalem. Hence ‘ Nicanor‘s day' is in the Jewish ca-
lendar.

Thist gate was πεντήκοντα πηχῶν τὴν ἀνάστασιν, &c., ‘ fifty
cubits in height 3’ the doors contained forty cubits, and very
richly adorned with silver and gold, laid on to a great

thickness.''
Inu that gate sat a council of three and twenty3 as there

was another in the gate of Susan.
