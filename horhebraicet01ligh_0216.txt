Rhinoeorura, and Raphia Inwards. Sometimes also in the
Holy Scripture it is called Shur3 and instead of it, in those
interpretem, it is called ‘Chagra.’ VVhence is the name of
mount Angaris eoncerning which Pliny speaks,-“ Gaza, and
inwards Anthedon, mount Angaris.'' For when the Syrians
pronouneed ‘ Chaggara,' the Greeks would sound a double
Gamma by oz and 9, and would say ⁴ Angara.’

Shur also is sometimes rendered by the eastern inter-
preters rnn‘m Ohaluzwh, as the Jerusalem Targum upon
Gen. xvi. 7 ; and Jonathan upon Exod. xv. 22. The Arabio
so renders Gerarim, Gen. xx. 1 ; and J onathan, Bared, Gen.
xvi. 14. Bared indeed, which signifies haic, you call in Greek
χάλαζαι and whether the Targumists use the Greek word,
when they render it (Mamali, let the reader judge.

Shur, sometimes in the Syriae interpreter, is ἾἾῖζ) Sud, as
Exod. xv. 22 ; the point for difference in the last letter being
placed amiss. In Gen. xvi. 7, ¹4, δήιον and Bared are ren-
dered by them Gedar, instead of Gerar, by the same error.
Bared in the Arabio is chred there, with two points placed
under the first letter instead of one.

The country of the Avites, eall it by what name you will,
ended at Gaza, being stretehed out thither in length, from
the river of Egypt, forty-four miles. But the Idumea which
we seek ended not there, but extended itself sarther into
J udea, swallowing up, under the name, that whole breadth of
the land, from the Mediterranean sea to the sea of Sodom,
according to the length of it.

Sne‘r. VL-Tlae whole portion of Simeon within [dumea.

Ir swallowed up, first, the whole portion of Simeon, a
great part of which was contained within the country of the
Avites ; but not a small part also extended itself fax-ther into
Judea. Mention is made of his ‘ fourteen eities,' Josh. xix.
is you tell them one by onej. but they are said to be only
thirteen, ver. 6; where the LXX make an even number, while
they take ἶΠηἾῐζτρ ›S‘lcarulcem not for a city, but render it, Οἱ
ἀγροὶ αὐτῶν, as if they had read ἶΠἻἾὶΖ] ⁶ their fiel<ls.' But
Sheba seems rather to be one and the same with Beersheba ;
and so the number is made equal.
