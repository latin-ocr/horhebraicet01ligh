Gz’rdle of the city. 61

ἆποκευτούυτων· something obscure. Many conjecture this
gate was called the ‘ Fish-gate,' because fish were carried
into the city through it : I rather, because it was the ‘ fish-
marketz' as the Sheep-gate was the market for sheep. Ze-
phaniah addeth, ηὲιῄῃῃ 3⁷2 Πξξη 2‘ And he shan howl from

the second.'' The Chaldee reads, &my 3⁷33 R. Solonion,
ΠἾΞἸῺΠ Ἶῃωζ) ‘ from the Bird-gate ε’ perhaps the gate, near
unto which fowls were sold. Kimchi reads, &5537 p: ‘ from
Ophe13’ more plain indeed,—-but I ask, whether more true?
Thisx Bird-gate perhaps was that which is called the Old-
gat-e, Neh. iii. 6.

Near the corner, looking south-west, we suppose, the
fountain of Siloam was3 and that, partly, being persuaded
by the words of J osephus before alleged,——partly, being in-
duced to it by reason itself. For hence flowed that fountain
by the south wall eastwardly to the Sheep-gate, as we sup-
pose; thence the river, somewhat sloping, bends towards
the north into the valley, and ends, at length, in the pool of
Siloam, at the foot of mount Sion.

On the west was, l. ΝἾᾸΠ *mv “ The gate of the valley,’'
ver. ῐ 3, being now gotten to the foot of mount Aera. And,
2. A thousand cubits thence, ΓΠΞΨΝΠ *mxv ‘⁴ The Esquiline,
or Dung-gate,” ver. 14. And, 3. ΓὩΠ *aym “ The Fountain-
gate,’' ver. 153 not that of Siloam, nor of Draco; but an-
other.

And now we are come to the pool of Siloam, and to the
foot of Sion, whither they went up by certain steps, ver. 15.
The pool of Siloam was first a fountain, and a river, on the
west, without the walls: but at last, Manasseh the king en-
closed all, 2 Chron. xxxiii. 14, that the city might be more
secured of water, in case of a siege: taught it by the ex-
ample of his grandfather Hezekiah, but more incommodious,
2 Chron. xxxii. 3.

The wall went forward along “ burying-places of David,
another pool‚ and the House of the strong,” ver. 16. And,
not much after it, bended eastwardly.—And now we are come
to the north side. See ver. 19, 20.

At the turning of this corner, Herod built the most famous
