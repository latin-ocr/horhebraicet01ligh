Jericlzo itseff. 99

It flourished more under the second Temple, so that it
gave place to no city in Judea; yea, all gave place to it,
besides Jerusalem. A royal palaceb was in it, where Herodc
ended his days: a Hippodromusd, where the J ewish nobility,
being imprisoned by him, were to be slain, when he expired ε
an amphitheatree, where his will was publicly opened, and
