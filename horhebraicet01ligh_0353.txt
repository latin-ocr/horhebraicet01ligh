in the Gemarists, who upon this place have this note :

“ There)⁷ was no country throughout the whole land of I srael
where the fruits of the earth were so forward as in Baal-Sha-
lisha.'' Now such a country they call ΠἾὩἾἾἾῺῙἼΖ ΠἾἯΠ
southern flelds,· or literally, made south; “because the sun
both riseth and sets upon them.” But why they should render

Methbaraa is something more unintelligible, unless it should
be with some respect to mount Tabor, which we find men-
tioned in the following chapter, ver. 3 3 and so ΝἿΞΠὮ Meth-
ὂανα, should be ‘⁵ the plain of Tabor.”

If now the reader can pitch upon any of these places we
have already named, or any other he may have niet with in
his reading, as that which our evangelist here lneaneth, let
him consider whether the article τοῦ may properly be prefixed
to it, when as the names of all cities and towns are of the
feminine gender generally, and yet St. John bath it τοῦ
Σαλείμ· which gives some ground of conjecture that the pas-
sage is to be understood not of any town or city, but of some
other matter 3 which, by way of exercitation, it may not be
amiss a little to enlarge upon.
