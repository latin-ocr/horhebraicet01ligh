name signifies.'’ Perhaps he might at that time think of
ΒΝ ΞἹἾ which imports the “increase of God.” ’

It would be endless to reckon up such variatione of letters
in proper names ς but as to t-he letter r, which is our business
at present, take these few instances :

⁶ Nebuchadnezzar' is elsewhere ⁴ Nebuchadrezzar ς’ ‘ Belial'
is ‘Beliar 3⁹ ‘ Sheplmm,' by the Greek interpreters, Σεφαμᾶρ,
Sephanear, Numb. xxxiv. 11: so Sychem, Sychar3 and this
so much the rather because the letters r and m have ob-
tainecl I know not what kind of relation and⁴ affinity one
with another. So Dammesek and Darmesek in the Holy
Scriptures3 and the ‘ Samaritans’ are the ‘ Samatians' in
Dionysius Afer, διο.

Or, secomlly, it might happen that the Jews, by way of
scoff and opprobrium, might vulgarly call Sychem Sychar,
either that they might stigmatize the Samaritans as ‘ drunk-
ards‚' Isa. xxviii. 1, “ Woe to the drzmkards [³5:212] of
Ephraim 3³³ or (as the word might be variously writ and pro-
nounced) might give them some or other disgraceful mark, as

Sochem i. e. sepulchres. He quotes a place n where the words
are not as they are by him cited3 nor is he consistent with
himself in the interpretation. But Munster bath *³:³0 a se-
pulchre. If it be thus, perhaps 0:12* Sychem might be called
Sychar, because there the twelve patriarchs were burz'ecl ,· and
under that notion the Samaritans might glory in that name.
