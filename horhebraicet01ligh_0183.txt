Gilqal. 1 73

that they may fix Gilgal near Gerizim and Eba13 where they
think the people encamped the first night after their entrance
into the land of Canaan, from those words of Moses, Deut.
xxvii. 2, ‘¹ ln the day, wherein thou shalt pass over Jordan,
thou shalt set thee up great stones, and shalt plaster them
with plaster,” &a Now those stones, say they, are set up
in Gerizim and Ebal. Hence is that of the Genmrists ¹1, “ 'she
Lord said, Ι said, WVhen ye shall pass J ordan, ye shall set up
stones3 but³1 you heve spread yourselves as far as sixty nliles.''
And Y, “ Gerizim and Ebal were sixty miles distant from
J ordan.''

But certainly by that Gilgal, of which Mosesss in those words
speaks, “ Are not Gerizim and Ebal ³722&ss ι73173 over-ayaiizst
Gilyal ,9³³ is to be understood some other than that which
Joshua named by that name, Josh. v. 9. For when Moses
spoke those words, the name of that GilgaL near J ericho, was
not at all: nor can that- which is spoke in the book of J oshua.
concerning ῑῖἒιῗλῖᾮ Ξῗῆἒ the natione* qs GilfyaZ, Josh. xii. 23, be
applied to ‘that GilgaL when it had obtained that name.

Therefore, in both places, by Gilyal seems to be understood
Galilee3 and that as well from the nearness of the words,—for

1ᾎῖἳὶ Gilyal, and 3742} Galil, are of the same root and ety-
mology‚-—as from the very sense of the places. For when, in
Joshua‚ some kings of certain particular cities in Galilee—
Kedesh, Jokneam, Dor, &e-aoe reckoned up, the king of
the nations of Gilgal, or Galilee Ζ, is also added, who ruled
over many cities and countries in Galilee.

So also the words of Moses may very well be rendered in
the like sense, ⁶ Are not those mountains, Gerizim and Ebal,
beyond Jordan, over-against Gilgal, or Galilec 3³

These things following strengthen our conjecture :—I. The
version of the LXX, who render [ζῖὶὲλὲ ΞΪἿΞ ΤΙιθ ozatioozs qf
