were on the north side of the city, learn of the same author
from these passages that follow :—

He saith plainly, that the towersl built by Her0d‚-·the
Psephin tower, the Hippio tower, &c.—-were on the north.
“ Titus (saith he m) intrenched two furlongs from the city on
the angular part of the wall near the Psephin tower, where
the circuit of the wall bends from the north towards the
west? And in the chapter next after; ‘⁶ The Psephin tower
lifted up itself at the corner of the north, and so westward.'’
And in the same chapter, describing the compass of the out-
most wall, Ἀρχόμενον δὲ (saith he n) κατὰ βοῤῥᾶυ ἀπὸ τοῦ

ἀντικρὺ τῆς βασιλικῆς αὐλῆς ἐστρατοπεδεύετο· “Being come to
the Upper Oity, he pitched against the king’s court.'’ And
a little astera Κατὰ τὸ προσάρκτιον ἐπιχειρεῖ κλίμα τῷ Ἱερῷ·

We shall not urge more at this time. There will occur
here and there to us, as we proceed, such things as may
defend this our opinion: against which what things are
objected, we know well enough3 which we leave to the reader
to consider impartially. But these two we cannot pass over in
silence, which seem, with an open face, to make against us:—

Ι. It may be objected, and that not without cause, that
Sion was in the tribe of J udah‚ but Jerusalem in the tribe of
Benjamin. But now, when the land of Judah was on the (1
