Mountainous country of Judea. 27

granted, that Pliny's measure extended so far, we might
compute the length of the land from the Sirbon‚ where also is
the river of Egypt, to Sidon, by this account :

l. From the Sirbon to the borders of Phoenice, one hundred
and eighty-nine miles—Pliny.

ΙΙ. From the first borders of Phoenice to Tyre‚ five miles.
-GuL Tyrius.

ΙΙΙ. From Tyre to Sidon, twenty—five miles—Strabo.

Sum total is two hundred and nineteen miles.

“WHATr is the mountainous country of Judea? ἼΠ Πῖ
*Ji-'Dm It is the king s mountain.'

However J udea here and there doth swell out much with
mountains, yet its chief swelling appears in that broad back
of mountains, that runs from the utmost southern coast as
fat as Hebron, and almost as Jerusalem itself. Which the
Holy Scripture calls ΠἾἸΠ“ ἼΠ ὀρειυη ἰούδα, “The hill-
countly of Judah‚” Josh. xxi. 11 Luke 1. 39.

Unless I am very much mistaken‚ ——the maps of Adri-
comus, Tirinius‚ and others, ought to be corrected, which
have seigned to themselves a very long back of mountains‚
beginning almost at the Rod Sea, and reaching almost to
the land of Oanaan, and that with this inscription, “The
Amor1hean Mountain. ' Those authors ale mistaken by an
ill interpletation of the phrase ἾἼῩΞζξζΠ ἼΠ ἛῘἾἾ, rendering
it, ‘in the way by³³ (or near)‘ ‘the mountain Ofs' the Amor-
ites, '-—when it should be rendered ‘in the way to the
mountain of the Amoritos.'⁵ Let the reader consult Deut.
i. 19, 20: “ &Vc departed from Horeb, and went through all
that great and terrible desert, which ye saw, ἾἾῩὶζξζΠ ἼΠ ῗῘἼἼ,
in the way leading to the mountain of the Anioritc, as our
Lord commanded us, and came to Cadesh-baruca. Then I
said unto you, You are now come to the mountain of tho
Amoritcs,” &c.
