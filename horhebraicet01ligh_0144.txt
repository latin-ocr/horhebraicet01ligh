Weigh this storyu: “Onex brought a bill of divoree to
R. Ismae13 who said to him, Whenee are you? He answered‚
5:37 Dar-mnu> ”UD ἾΞΞὈ F rom Caphar Samni, vehicla is
in the confines of Aeon.—Then it is needful, saith he, that
you say, It was written, I being present,—and sealed, I
being present. When he went out, R. Illai said unto him, Is
not Caphar Samai of the land of Israel, being nearer to
Zippor than Aaou? And a little after: “ The cities which
are in the borders of Zippor near to Aeon, and which are in
the borders of Aeon near to Zipp0r‚ what will you do oon-
eerning them? As Aeon is, so is Zippor.”

“ TRAVELLINGY from Aeon to Achzib, on the right hand
of the way, eastwardly, it is elean, from the notion of heathen
land, and is bound to tithes, and to the law of the seventh
year, until you are certified that it is free. On the left hand
of the way, west-ward, it is unelean, under the notion of
Gentile land; and it is free from tithes, and from the law
eoneerning the seventh year, till you are eertified it is bound
to those things, even until you come to Aehzib.'' The Gelnara
hath these words : but the text, on whieh is this eommentary,
is this : “ Thez three countries'' (namely, Judea, Galilee, ancl
Perea) “ are bound to the law of the seventh year: whatso-
ever they possessed, who came up out of Babylon, from the
land of Israel unto 2³32 Chozib (the Jerusalem Misna reads
2³3) Ghezib), is not fed nor tilled: but whatsoever they
possessed, who earne up out of Egypt, from Chezib to the
river, and to Amanah, is fed, but not tilled: from the river
and from Amanah, inwards‚ is fed and tilled.”
