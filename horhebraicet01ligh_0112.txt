Theyp believe, also, that the bulk of the host took up the
same space, while they passed Jordan. Nor is it unfit so to
believe : for it, indeed. seems at least to have taken up a very
large space in its passage: this especially being observed,
that, while the ark stood in the middle of Jordan, none might
come within two thousand eubits near it, J osh. iii.4. When,
therefore, it is said, “ that the people passed over against
Jordan,” it is to be understood of the middle of the host,—or
of those that carried the ark, and of those that went next
after the ark.

Fromq Abel to Jordan, were sixty furlongs (seven miles
and a half). The breadth of Jordan from bank to bank was
but of a moderate space. The Jerusalem Talmudistsr do
write thus of it, in some part of it: “ A fire sometime passed
over J ordan’' (that is, a flame kindled on this bank flew over
to that). ‘⁴ But how far is the flames carried? R. Eleazar
saith, For the most part to sixteen cubits; but when the
wind drives it, to thirty—R. Judah saith, To thirty cubits;
and, when the wind drives it, to fifty.—R. Akibah saith, To
fifty eubits ; and when the wind blows, to a hundred.''

From t Jordan to Gilgal were fifty furlongs (six miles and a
quarter). Therefore the whole journey of that day, from
Abel to Gilgal, was fourteen miles, or thereabouts. The
TalmudistS, being deceived by the ambiguity of the word

3733?ss Gilgml, extend it to sixty u miles, and more: whom see
afterward quoted in the eighty-eighth chapter. lt is thus
said in Midras Tillin, “ Saulx went, in one day, threeseore
miles.”

Of the stones, set up by J oshua in Jordan and Gilgal, the
Gemarists y have these words :v—“ R. J udah saith, Aba Cha-
laphta, and R. Eleazar Ben Mathia, and Chaninah Ben Cha-
kinai, stood upon those stoneS, and reckoned them to weigh
forty sata eaeh.”
