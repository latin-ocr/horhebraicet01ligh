Beth-el. Beth-aven. 45

τὸ δὲ πλάτος, Ἱεροσολύμοις ὁριζομένην, καὶ Βεθήλοις· “The
Benjamites’ portion of land was from the river Jordan to the
sea, in length : in breadth, it was bounded by Jerusalem and
Beth-el.’' Let these last words be marked, “ The breadth of
the land of Benjamin was bounded by Jerusalem and
Beth-el.” May we not justly conclude, from these words,
that Jerusalem and Beth-el were opposite, as it were, in a
right 11116ἶΡ But if you look upon the maps, there are some
that separate these by a very large tract of land, and make
them bend and slope from one another.

Beth-el heretofore was Luz: of which the Rabbins upon
Judg. i. 23, Sco. do not a little trifle. Sometimes it is called
Beth-aven. So the Talmudists3 “ Thate town, which some-
times was called Beth-el, afterward was called Beth-aven.''
And the Chaldee upon Hos. iv. 15: &Nn-,337 ῖἿῦῠΠ &³7
“ Gro not up to Beth-el? for the Hebrew, ἶἾξ 1-1Ἶὲ ηἶῦ-ζζξι ³723
“ Gro not up to Beth-aven.'' So also chap. x. 5, 8. Not that
there was not another town, named Beth-aven (see Josh.
xviii. 12, 13): but that Beth-el too deservedly bore the re-
proaeh of that name, 111 the same manner as Jerusalem bore
the name of Sodom, Isa. i. 10.

It is said of Deborah, that she lived ‘⁶ between Ramah
and Beth-el in mount Epln·ai1n‚'' Judg. iv. 5: where the
Targum thus3 “She had gardens in Ramatha, olive-trees
making oil in the valley‚ a house of watering in Beth-013³
Not that Beth-el properly was in the hill-country of Ephraim,
since that town stood upon the very boundaries of J udea;
but that the dwelling of Deborah was at the beginning of
that hill-country, a valley running between that hill-country
and those boundaries. Beth—el itself was situate in a hilly
country, J osh. xvi. 1 ς which yet one would scarcely call the
hill-country of Ephraim (since there was a time, when Beth-el
and her towns belonged to J udea, 2 Chron.xiii. 19: 1101100
the idolatry of those of J udah is sometimes mixed with thc
Ephraimites’, of which they hear often enough from the pro-
phets) 3 but it was a certain hilly place, running out between
J udea and the land of Ephraim : see J osh. xviii. 12.

On the east of Beth—el heretoforc was Hai, (1011. xii. 8,

υ Hieros. Shab. fol. 11. 4. et Avml. Zur. sol. ⁴3- 3.
