These dens, therefore, were cut out of mountains and rocks
for the uses of war, that they might serve for refuge and
strength. And it is probable the Ganaanites, a warlike and
gigantic nation, had digged very many of these caves before
the entrance of the Israelites into that land 3 and that the
Israelites also increased the number of them. See concerning
these caves, Josh. x. 163 Judg. vi. 23 1 Sam. xxii. 1, and
xxiv. 33 1 Kings xviii. 133 Isa. ii. 19, διο.

O H A P. O.
Of the places of Burial.

THERE were more common and more noble sepulchres.
The common were in public burying-places, as it is with us:
but they were without the city. “ Andc through that place
was no current of waters to be made; through it was to be
no public way ; cattle were not to seed there, nor was wood
to be gathered from thence.''

“ Nord was it lawful to walk among the sepulchres with
phylacteries fastened to their heads, nor with the book of the
law hanging at their arm.'’

Some sepulchres were extraordinary; that is, in reference
to the place of their situation. As, 1. ΝΞῺΞΠ Ἤρ Α ⁶ se-
pulchre foucrzd‚· that is, when a sepulchre is in somebody's
field without his knowledge3 but at last the sepulchre is dis-
covered. 2. ΕἮἾΠ ΠΝ ,ῬῖῗὲΓῖ 'Dp A sepulchre that is pub-
Zicly owoez'ous,· that is, digged near some place of common
walk or travel: from the nearness of which the passengers
cont-raet pollution.

The more noble sepulchres were hewn out in some rock,
in their own ground, with no little charge and art. You have
the form of them described in the place noted in the margins,
in these words :

“ He that selleth his neighbour a place of burial, and ho
that takes of his neighbour a place of burial, let him make
