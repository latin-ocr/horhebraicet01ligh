Bethesda. 361

either in signs or languages had this name given them from
Mordecai‚ who, in the days of Ahasuerus, was so skilled.

And now let the reader give us his judgment as to name
and place3 whether it doth not seem to have some relation
with our well of Sychar. It may be disputed on either side.
I shall only say these things :

Menachoth, as before3 “Itis commanded that the sheaf
be brought from some neighbouring place, ΞἸἾΡΠ '2³2 &³7
'D ’73 'mm Γζφὲἵ) ’ἾῖἍΒἾἾἿΖῬ but if it ripen not in omps ploce
near Jerusalem, let them fote-lt it elsewhere? Gloss: “ Gaggoth
Zeriphin and Ein Sychar were at a great distance from J e-
msalem.” So is our Sychar distant far enough indeed.

‘¹ ΓΓἾΒ Ζανὶρίι, and ΠΞἿἾΒ Zeriplza, denotes a little cottage,

Πη-γω 'now ἓν] 37³7? where the keeper of flelds toctqedtss’ It
is described by Aruch in the word ἒ-ΤἻΕ, that “it was covered
over with osier twigs, the tops of which were bound toge-
ther, and it was drawn at ple-asure from one place to an-
other‚” &a ’

Gloss. in Erubhin: ΤΞἿἾΞ *mm* “ They that dwelt in those
cottayes were keepers of sheep; they abode in them for a
month or two, so long as the pasture lasted, and then they
removed to another places* Gaggoth Zeriphin, therefore, sig-
nifies the roofs of little cottayes: and the place seems to be
so called either from the number of such lodgos in that place,
or from some hills there, that represented and seemed to have
the shape of such kind of cottageS.

Such cottages may come to mind when we read, Luke ii. 8,
of the shepherds watching their flocks by night. But this is
out of our way.
