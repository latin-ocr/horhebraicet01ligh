Cana was a great way distant from Tiberias: J osephus “¹
spent a whole night travelling from this town to that with
his army. It was situate against· J ulias of Betharamphtha, as
may be gathered from the same author in the place quoted ‘¹
in the margin. Now that J ulias was situate at the very influx
of Jordan into the sea of Gennesaret.

These things might be more largely explained and illus-
stated, but we are afraid of being too long; and so much the
more, because we have treated copiously of them elsewhere.
This will be enough to an unbiassed reader‚ to whose judg-
ment we leave it; and now go on to Dalmanutha.

Smer. IL——Nnunit'tsffi ,ΠἮ Zalmon. Thence Dalmanutlza.

Ir we may play a little with the name Dalmanuffla, hear
a Talmudical tradition. “ He0 that· sells a farm to his neigh-
bour, or that receives a place from his neighbour, '137 D'ffljyss
amb munh& rum *¹:2³7 nni-sn rw: to make him α house of
betrotlzinsr for· his son, or a house of widowlcoodfor his dactylitem
let him build it four cubits this way, and six that.” WVhere the
Gloss, ἸΠΞῚἿ ,munim ,ΠἮ “A house of widowkood for his
dauqlztm whose husband is dead, and she now returns to the
house of her father.”

The meaning of this tradition is, ⁶ NVhen the son of any
one had married a wife, he did not use to dwell with his fa-
ther—in-law3 but it was more customary for his father to
build him a little house near his own house.' So also when
the husband was dead, and the daughter, now being a widow,
returned to her father, it was also customary for the father
to build her a little house ; in which she dwelt, indeed, alone,
but very near her father,

ssutp now from some such house of inore note than ordi-
nary, built for some eminent widow; or from many such
honses standing thick together, this place, perhaps, might
be called &rmnbts‘i Dalmanutha, that is, “ The placo of
widowhood.'' And if some more probable derivation of the

name occurred not, it might, not without reason, have had
respect to this.
