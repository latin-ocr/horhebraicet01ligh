2 Sam. xx. 18, discens-sed. 307

things have failed which the faithful of Israel laid up. Asking
they will ask in Abel, and so if they have failed.''

If any one can make any tolerable sense of these words,
he would do well to teach others how to do it too ς especially
let them tell the reason ⁴why Dan should be added here. lt
is true Dan and Abel-betvh-maachah are mentioned together
as not very distant from one another, ι Kings xv. 20: and
if we do by the words understand their neighbourhood to
one another, l see nothing else that can be picked out of
them.

However, both the Roman and Alexandrian editions agree
in this reading, which have the preference of all other
editions of the Greek version. And let them now, who
are for correcting the Hebrew Bibles by the Greek, say,
whether they are for having them corrected here; only let
them give me leave to enjoy the Hebrew text as we now
have it..

The Hebrew makes the sense plain, if the first words
'7wass ἎἾΞΓῙἾ ἾᾈἾ be but rightly applied, namely‚ to
Sheba and his party speaking; “When Sheba and his fol-
lowers came hither, they at first certainly said thus, That
they would ask Abel of its peace, or on whose side it wa&

³1an lm and so they made the matter entire? or made a
show of their own integrity. For that that J oab was chiefly
to be satisfied in, was, that this city had not taken part with
the conspirators3 which is directly done, if we admit this
sense and interpretation of the words. This prudent woman
assures him, that “those of Abel had by no means invited
Sheba and his sellow-rebels into their town, or by any consent
with them in their rebellions, would ever willingly have
admitted them3 but that they were miserably deceived by
their fawning and false words, while they only prctended to
inquire about the peace and well-being of that city: and
that you may know more effectually that all this is true
which I now affirm to you, we will immediately throw you
the head of Sheba over our walls*
