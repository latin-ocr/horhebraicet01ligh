“ Rabba Bar Bar Channah saith, They were not Babylo-
nians, but Alexandrians3 but, because they hated the Baby-
lonians, therefore they called them by their name. Take
it, and go, Why does this goat tarry, when theb sins of this
generation are so many3” Where the Gloss thus; “They
made him a footstool, or something to put under his feet,
that he might be higher: and upon this he went out of the
court, and out of the city: and this, lest the Babylonians
should touch the goat: for they used to pull off his hair, and
to say, ΘΟ, make haste, begone, delay not, our sins are yet
upon us.'’ And after3 ‘¹ The inhabitants of the land of
Israel hated the Babylonians3 every one, therefore, carrying
himself irreverently and indecently, they called by their
name.”

Jerusalem.
