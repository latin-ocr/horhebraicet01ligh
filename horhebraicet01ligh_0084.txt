The Altar. The Rinys. The Laver.

Thet altar waS‚ on every side, two-and-thirty eubits; after
the ascent of one cubit, it was so straitened, that it was less
by one cubit in the whole square‚—that is, on every side thirty
cubits. It went up five cubitS‚ and again was straitened a
cubit3 so that there it was eight and twenty cubits on every
side. The place of the horns on every part was the space of
one cubit3 so that now it was six and twenty cubits every
way. The place of the priests’ walk, hither and thither, was
one eubit; so that the place of burning extended four and
twenty cubits round about.

A scarlet thread begirt the middle of the altar, to discern
between the upper bloods and the lower.

The basis of the altar towards the south-east had no
corner, because that part was not within the portion of
J udah.

At the horn between the west and the south were two
heles, like nostrils, through which the sprinkled blood de-
sceflded, and fiowed into the brool< Kedron.

The aseent to the altar was, on the south, two and thirty
cubits, and the breadth sixteen cubits. ThereUl was a time,
when, upon this ascent, one priest stabbed another priest

with his knife, while they strove who should first get up to
the altar.

On the north were six orders of rings, each of which con-
tained four. There are some who assert there were four
orders, and each contained six, at which they killed the
sacrifices: there, therefore, was the place of slaughter. Near
by were low pillars set up, upon which were laid, overthwart‚
beams of cedar: in these were fastened iron hooks> on which
the sacrifices were hung; and they were flayed on marble
tames, which were between those pillars.

There was a laver or eistern between the perch and the
altar, and it lay a little to the south. “ lien Kattinx made
twelve cocks for it, which before had but two. IIe also
