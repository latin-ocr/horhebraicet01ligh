bul, because they displeased him, but restored them back to
Solomon in some indignation.

Kimehi on the place more rightly, “ It is very well ex-
pounded, that Hiram gave cities to Solomon in his own
land; and he placed Israeltes there to strengthen himself.
And he, in like manner, gave cities to Hiram in Galilee ς and
that to strengthen the league between them. In the Book
of the Kings it is recorded what Solonion gave to Hiram;
and in this,” of the Chronicles, “ what Hiram gave to 8010-
111011.” Most true indeed: for that Hiram gave to 8010111011
801110 cities in his jurisdiction, appears beyond all contro·
versy from thence, that Solonion is said to build Tadmor
in the wilderness‚ 1 Kings ix. 18. But what is that place
Tadmor? Josephus will teach us: Θαδαμόρα ...... οἰἝλληνες
προσαγορεύουσι Παλμυράν· “ Thadalnor (saith he f), the Greeks
call Palmy1·a.” And the Vulgar interpreters read, “ He built
Palmyra.” Therefore we must by 110 means think that Hiram
rejected the cities that were given him by Solonion, however
they pleased him not3 but kept them for his own, which
Solomon also did with them which Hiram gave to him.

Butg whence should the Greek interpreters render that
place called LMZD Claabzd by ‘'Optov, a coast, when there is no
affinity at all between the significatione of the words?

SECT. III.—Tloe Greek Interpretare noted.

THE Greek interpreters are not seldom wont to render the
names of places, not by that name as they are called in the
Hebrew text, but as they are called in after-times under
the second Temple ε which is also done often by the Chaldee
Targumists. Of this sort are, Καππάδοκες, Cappadociam, for
Gaphtorim z Ῥινοκόρουρα, Rlcinocorura, for ‘ the river of
Egypt ς’ of which we have spoken before: and among very
many examples which might be produced, let us compare 0110
place out of the Talmudists with them.
