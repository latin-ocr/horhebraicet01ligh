Πόλις, one might call it ‘ The New Oity X? '³ And yet there is
a place where he seems to distinguish between Bezetha and
the New City: sor he saith concerning Cestius, ΚέστιοςΥ δὲ
παρελθὼν, &c., ‘⁶ But Cestius, passing over, set fire upon
Bezetha, so called, and the New Gity.’'

BezethaZ was seated on the north part of Antonia, and
that and Caenopolis (or the New City) filled up that space,
where Sion ended on the east, and was not stretched out so
far as Aera was. Πλήθειὸ ὑπερχεομένη (ἡ πόλις) κατὰ μικρὸν
ἐξεῖρπε τῶν περιβόλων, &c.‚ “ (The city), abounding with
people, crept, by little and little, out of the walls: and on
the north side of the Temple, at the hill, making a city, went
onward not a little; καὶ τέταρτον περιοικηθῆναι λόφον, ὃς καλεῖ-
ται Βεζεθὰ, ἅτε. and a fourth hill is inhabited, which is called
Bezetha,'' &Q

Interpreters differ about Millo. There is oneb, who sup-
poses it to be a large place, appointed for public meetings and
assemblies. AnotherC interprets it of heaps of earth, thrown
up against the wall within, whence they might more easily
get up upon the wall: and when David is said to build
Millo, that he erected towers upon these heaps, and banks.
Some others there are, who understand it of the valley 01·
street that runs between Jerusalem and Sion; and so it is
commonly marked out in the maps,—when‚ in truth, Millo
was a part of Sion, or some hilloek cast up against it on the
west side.

Let that be observed, 2 Chron. xxxii. 53 Νῆἶῖῒῷζῖ ἺἾζῇζ Ρζῐζὶᾞ
ἾὙἿ ἾἾᾙ “ And he restored, or fortified, Mille, of the city of
Dayid :’' or, as our English reads, “ in the city os David.'’
The Seventy read, τὸ ἀνάλημμα τῆς πόλεως Δαυὶὸ, “ the fortifi-
cation of the city of David.'’ When, therefore, David is said
to build “ Mille, and more inwards,'' it is all one as is he
had said, ‘he built on the uttermost part of Sion, which was
called Mille, more inwardly to his own castle.’ And Joab
repaired tho rest, 1 Chron. xi. 8.

The‘l street or valley, running between Sion and Aera, was
