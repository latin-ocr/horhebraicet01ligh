Auranitis. 501

any one will question, especially that observes ‘7³23 ¹733} ἾΨζ-κξ
3225] Ezek. xlvii, 16, to be rendered by the Greek interpretem,
Αἵ εἰσιν ἐπάνω τῶν ὁρίων Αὐρανίτιδος, “ which are upon the
borders of Auranitis.”

Hauran is reekoned up amongst those hills, at the top of
which, by lifting up some flaming torches, they were wont to
give notice of the new year.

to Beth Baltin. And from Beth Baltin, he that held up the
light there, did not depart, but waved it hither and thither,
up and down, till he saw the lights kindled throughout the
whole eaptivity.”

Thea Gemarist queries, “ What is Beth-Baltin? Rabh
saith, It is Biram. What is the eaptivity? Rabh <Ioseph
saith, It is Pombeditha.” Gloss: “ The sense of it is this:
That Biram is in the land of Israel.” How! is Eiram the
same with Beth Baltin, and yet is Biram within the land of
Israel? when, in the Jerusalem Gemara, “ Rabh Honna
saith, W hen we came hither, we went up to the top of Beth
Baltin, and discerned the palm trees in Babylon.” If this
be true, the geographers are to consider whether there can
be any prospect of Babylon from the land of Israel. In
their sense it may be true enough, who commonly by the
name of Babylon understand all those countries into which
the Babylonish captivity were carried3 not only Chaldea,
but Mesopotamia also, and Assyria. So that bounding the
land of Israel with the river Euphrates (which, indeed, the
Holy Scriptures themselves do), they make it contiguous with
Mesopotamia, the river only between; and they place Beth
Baltin not far from the bank on this side the river.

The Gemarists acknowledge that lights were lifted up upon
some hills between those which they had mentioned 3 but
these were the most known and celebrated, and therefore they
named them only. Now it is probable enough that mount
Hauran gave the denomination to the whole country Auran-
