names, which, as they are there rendered, are still more per-
plexed and unknown. Consult the names used there for the
rivers& of Eden, and the countries which those rivers ran
into, and you will see how difficult it is any where else to
meet with the least sootstep or track of those names, except
Copkin only, which seems indeed to agree something with
Cophen mentioned by Plinyh.

Il. Places of themselves pretty well known are there called
by names absolutely unknown. Such are ἾΞΕΠ Ohatsphu, ·
for Assyria, Gen. ii. 14: [7547 Lilak, for Babel, Gen. X. 9:
ΠΝὮῐἊΖ] δἀἶηῑααῖι for Euphrates, Gen. xv. 18: 5:³5] Naploik
sor Egypt, Gen. xxvi. 2.

ΙΙΙ. Sometimes there are names of a later date used, and
such as were most familiarly known in those days. Such
are 0·ζῆὋὲ Bauius for Dan, Gen. xiv. 14, that is, Fauiam, the
spring of Jordan: ἻΞΞἮ Gennesar for Chinnereth, Numb.
xxxiv. 1 1, Deut. iii. 17: not to mention Bathnan and Apamia
for Bashan and, Shepham, which are so near akin with the
Syriae pronunciation : and Gebalah, or Gablah, for Seir, ae-
cording to the Arabio idiom.

Sueh names as these make me suspect the Samaritan ver-
sion not to be of that antiquity which some would claim for
it, making it almost as ancient as the days of Ezra.

IV. Ι suspect too, when we meet with places pretty well
known of themselves, obscured by names most unknown, that,
sometimes, the whole country is not to be understood, but
some particular place of that country only.

Tho suspicion is grounded on the word Naplcik for quypc,
and Salmaczlc sor Euphrates. By Napleik, probably, they un-
derstood, not the whole land of Egypt, but Pelusimn only,
which is the very first entry into Egypt from Ganaan. The
reason of this conjecture is this: the word pez& Anpak (as
we have elsewhere observed) was writ over tho gates os that
eity; and how near that word eomes to Naplce‘la, is obvious
enough to any one.

lt is possible, also, that the mention of the Inmites, imme-
diately following, might bring Nalnmala to mind3 and so they
might not call ² Euphrates' iuelf ‘Salnmahss but speaking of
