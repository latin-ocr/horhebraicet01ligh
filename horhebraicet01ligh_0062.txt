πόλιν ἐλθὼν, ἀντικρὺ τῆς βασιλικῆς αὐλῆς ἐστρατοπεδεύετο·
“ Cestius’' (having wasted the other places of the cit-y) “ came
at- length into the Upper Oity [Sion] and encamped against
the king's court.’'

then the Romans had fired Acra, and levelled it with
the ground Θ, οἱ στασιασταὶ ἐπὶ τὴν βασιλικὴν ὁρμήσαντες αὐλὴν,
“ the seditious rushing into the court, into which, by reason
of the strength of the place, they had conveyed their goods,
call away the Romans thither.'' And afterwardf: Καῖσαρ δ’,
ὡς ἀμήχανον, &c. ‘⁶ But, when it was in vain to assault the
Upper City without ramparts, as being every where of steep
access‚ Caesar applies his army to the work‚’' &c.

the Xystus.'' Wheni Pompey assaulted the city, the Jews
took the Temple, καὶ τὴν τείνουσαν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ γέφυραν εἰς τὴν
πόλιν ἔκοψαν· ‘⁶ and broke down the bridge that led thence
into the city. But others received the army, and delivered
the city and the king's court to Pompey.''

Andk Titus, when he besieged the seditious in thc court
in the Upper City, raises the engines of four legions, κατὰ τὸ
πρὸς δύσιν κλίμα τῆς πόλεως, ἀντικρὺς τῆς Βασιλικῆς αὐλῆς, &c.,
‘⁶ on the west side of the city, against the king’s court. But
the associated multitude, and the rest of the people‚ were
before the Xystus and the bridge.”
