‘⁴ The ascent of Beth-horon was a strait place3 nor was there
room to bend to the right hand or to the left.''

The story of Cestius, the Roman captain, in J osephus, is
sad, but not unseasonable in this place. I-Iez intrenched
against Jerusalem, in a place called the Scope (ἐπὶ τοῦ καλου-
μένου Σκοποῦ), 011 the north part of the city (which we shall
show hereafter): and being at length forced by the Jews to
retreat, μόγις εἷς Γαβαὼ κατήντησαν ἐπὶ τὸ πρότερον στρατόπε-
δον, “ he came near to Gabaon, to his former camp.” And
being presscd farther by them, he betook himself to Beth-
horon3 Προῆγε τὴν δύναμιν ἐπὶ Βαιθώρας, “ He led his forces
to Beth-horon.''

“ But the Jews, whilst he marched along places where
there was room, did not much press him3 Συνειληθέντων δὲ
εἷς κατὰ στενὰ κατάβασιν· but they getting before the Romans
who were shut up within the straits of the descent (of Beth-
horon), stopped them from going out: others thrust them
that came in the rear down into thc valley. And the whole
multitude being spread ὑπὲρ τὸν αὐχένα τῆς ὁδοῦ, at the
opening of the way, covered the army with their dartS.''

Beholdl the way leading from Jerusalem to Beth-horon:-

Ι. From the city to Scope (0ἾῦῚὲ of which we shall speak
afterward)‚ is seven furlongs. For so Josephus, Διέχει δὲ
ἑπτὰ τῆς πόλεως σταδίους.

ΙΙ. From Scope to Gabao, or Goba, forty-three furlongs.
For Gabao was distant from Jerusalem, thc same Joscphus
relating it, fifty furlongs,—that is, six miles and more.

III. From Geba to Beth-horon fifty furlongs‚ 01· there-
abouts. And about Beth-horon was a very great roughness
of hills, aud a very narrow passage.
