lee Sea of Sodom, 27³va ΕΡ.

The bounds of Judea, on both sides, are the sea; the
western bound is the Mediterranean,—-the eastern, the Dead
sea, or the sea of Sodom. This the ,Jewish writers every
where call nssmn ω, which you may not so properly in-
terpret here, ‘⁶ the salt sea,'' as “the bituminous· sea.'' In
which sense ΠἾὮἸἻΕ) Πῖἳῃ word for word, “Sodom’s salt,''
but properly “ Sodom's bitulnen,'' doth very frequently occur
among them. The use of it was in the holy incense. They
mingled ,ΠἺΞῚἻΒ riba ‘bitumen1,' ῑἺἾἾΠ ΠΞΞ ‘the amber
of .Jordan‚' and Ἴων 1473773, an herb known to feW‚ with the
spices that made that incense.

Ἀσφαλί-ίτιςΠΙ λίμνη ἀπέχει τῶν Ἱεροσολυμιτῶν ὅρων σταδίους
τ’; “The lake Asphaltitis is distant from Jerusalem three
hundred furlongs :''-—ab0ut eight-and-thirty miles.

ΤαύτηςΙΙ τῆς λίμνης μῆκος μὲν ὀγδοήκοντα καὶ πεντακόσιοι
στάδιοιε “ It is extended in length five hundred and eighty
surlongs ;'' seventy-two miles—Esspos δὲ πεντήκοντα καὶ ἑκατόν;
“ in breadth a hundred aud fifty furlongs ;'' eighteen miles.

Plinyo speaks thus of it: “In length it is more than a
hundred miles: in its greatest breadth, it makes five-and-
twenty,——in its least, six.’' What agreement is there between
these two? I suppose J osephus does not comprehend within
his measure the conque of the sea, of which mention is made,
J osh. xv, 2.——and defines the breadth, as it was generally every
where diffused. Concerning its distance from Jerusalem,
Solinusv also speaks: “In a long retreat from Jerusalem
(saith he) a sad hay openeth itself ς which that it was struck
from heaven, the ground, black and dissolved into ashes, testi-
fies. There were two towns there, one named Sodom, the
other Gomorrha.’' But that distance was not directly south-
ward, but by a very long declination eastward.

The Talmudists devote “ to the sea of Sodom,'' ΓΙῖὮΤΞΠ 0³³7
any thing, that is destined to rejection and eursffig, and that
by no means is to be used.
