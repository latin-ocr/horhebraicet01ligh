CHA P. XXXI.

Conceminff tlte Gates and Chambers Zyiny on the Sozam
Side of the Oourt.

ΗΕΗΕ, concerning the chamberS, they differ. The tract
Middoth assigns these to the south side3 “ They chamber of
wood, the chamber of the spring water, the chamber Ga-
zith.''——The Babylonian 6101111113Ζ and Maimonidesa assign
them to the north side. In Middoth, “ the chamber of salt,
the chamber of Happarva, the chamber of them that wash,''
were on the north side: in those, they are said 10 bc on the
south. The matter is hardly of so great moment, that we
should weary ourselves in deciding this controversy. We
enter not into disputes, but follow those things that are more
probable, the Middoth being our guide.

Ι. Therefore· we suppose, first, that the chamber Gazith
was on the south side of the court, near the east corner: and
that upon this reason,—that since, according to all the Jews
(howsoever differ-ing on what side it was placed), this cham-
ber was not in the middle of the three chambers before
named, but on the outside‚ either on the one hand 01· on the
othe1·,—-the council could not sit 111 1110 101 of J udah, if Gazith
were not seated about that place which we assign.

Gazith was in the form of a 577*th court wall: And half of
it was in the Holy Place, and the other half in that which
was common: and it had two d00rs3 whereof 0110 opened to-
wards the Holy Place,—thc other towards that which was
common :'’—that is, 0110 11110 1110 court, the other to the
Chal. The great Sanhedrim sat in that part, which was in
Cloe& for “ noue might sit in the court, unless kings only
