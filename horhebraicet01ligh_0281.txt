The Roman 9a7·7·2'sons. 271

dying before the thirtieth day of his age hath no need of a
bier, but is carried in his mother's bosom to burial, two men
accompanying3 but he is not carried by two women, one man
only accompanying. And this reason is given3 because when
the burying-places were a good way distant from the city,
it might happen that two women might be enticed by one
man to commit whoredom, when they were now out of the
sight of men3 but two nien would not so readily conspire to
defile one woman.

They produce examples: “ A certain woman (say they)
carried out a living infant as though it were dead, to play
the whore with him who accompanied her to the place of
burial.''——And, “ Ten men took up a living woman as though
she were dead, that they might lie with ber.'' Certainly thou
forgettest thyself, O J ew, when one while thou sayest that
two men would scarcely conspire together for the defiling the
same woman, and other while that ten men did.

The burying-places were distant two thousand cubits srom
the Levitical cities3 from all other cities a great space, if not
the same. How far Jerusalem agreed with these in this
matter, or not agreed, we must observe elsewhere.

not so common in every one's hand.
