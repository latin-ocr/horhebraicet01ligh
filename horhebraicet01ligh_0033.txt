the sea is valley,”

J udea is not divided amiss into four parts:—namely, into
the country, which formerly was the Philistines', which takes
up the western part. To this joins, on the east, the moun-
tainous country of J udea, which is also called “ The king's
mount.'' To the mountainous country, on the east, joins a
plain, a country more low and level than the mountains,
which nevertheless here and there hath its hills. Hence is
that, ἾΠΞἮ Πῖἳῦψ, &c “Ay valley, lying between moun-
tains‚ is reckoned with the mountains‚ and mountains in a
valley are numbered with the valley.” To to the plain east-
wardly joins a valley‚ lower than the plain‚—namely‚ the coast
of the sea of Sodom‚ and at length of Jordan.

TheZ land of Benjamin, in like manner, which is number-ed
with Judea, in respect of its superficies, was of the same
nature; which, although στενότατος ὁ κλῆρος οὗτος ἢν διὰ τὴν
τῆς γῆς ἀρετὴν, “ ita was a portion of the narrowest limfis, by
reason of the goodness of the soil‚” yet had its mountainous
part, its plain, and vale: and that, not only towards Lydda,
and the great sea, but towards J ericho and Jordan.

Judea did excel all the other parts of the land of Israel in
very many privileges. For, besides that in it was seated J e-
rusalem, the metropolis of the whole nation‚ and in Jerusalem
stood the Temple, and in the Temple sat the Sanhedrim;—
this was also peculiar to it out of the Canons, that “itb was
not lawful to intercalate the year out of Judea, while they
might- do it in Judea3' MaimonidesC gives the reason of the
thing. “Because there dwelt the divine glo1·y.”—“N0rd was
the sheaf of the first-fruits of the barley to be fetched else-
where, than from J udea, and as near as might be to J eru-
salem.⁵³ Oncee it was fetched a great way off, Sco.
