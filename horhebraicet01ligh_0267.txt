under the second Temple its holiness ceased. They sow it,
therefore, the seventh γεω-ς and they appoint thence the
first tithe, and the poor’s tithe the seventh year, for the main-
tenance of the p00r3 who have not a corner of the field left,
nor a gleaning that year: thither therefore the poor betake
themselves, and have there a corner left, and a gleaning‚ and
the poor's tithe.'’

We produce this, for the sake of that story which relates
how the Ohristians fied from the siege and slaughter of Jeru-
salem to Pella. And why to Pella? Certainly if that be
true which obtains among the JeWS‚ that the destruction of
Jerusalem was ΠἾὩἾΞΨΞ ‘in the seventh year,' which was
the year of release, when on this side Jordan they neither
ploughed nor sowed, but beyond Jordan there was a harvest,
and a tithing for the poor, &c.; hence one may fetch a more
probable reason of that story than the historians themselves
give; namely‚ that those poor Christians resorted thither for
food and sustenence‚ when husbandry had ceased that year in

Judea and Galilee. But we admire the story, rather than
acquiesce in this reason.

Caphar Amas‚· which one would wonder at. But this is not
so strange to the Chaldee and Syriae dialect, with which it is
very usual to change Β (Tsade) into y (Ain). So that the
Rabbin in the pronouneing of this word 0723? Amas, plays the
Syrian in the first letter, and the Grecian in the last, ending
the word in D (Samecli) for Π (Choth).
