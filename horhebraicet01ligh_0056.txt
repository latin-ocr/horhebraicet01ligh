Josh. viii. 9, διο. But upon the very first entrance almost of
Israel into the land of promise, it became thenceforth of no
name, being reduced into eternal ashes by Joshua. The town
Beth-aven was not far from it, J osh. vii. 2, which gave name
to the wilderness adjacent, J osh. xviii. 12. In which we sup-
pose Ephraim stood, 2 Chron. xiii. 19. Which Ephraim, in
the New Testmnent, is called χώρα ἐγγὺς τῆς ἐρήμου, “the
region near the wilderness‚” John xi. 54; concerning which
we shall speak afterward.

THE first name of this city was Shalem‚ Gen. giv.18‚
Psalm lxxvi. 2, and it is still retained in the writing ΕΫἋΖΠἾἾ,

“ W'ee do not, therefore, put in Jod between the letters
Lamed and Mem in the word Jerusalem, that the word Dlss’w
Slmlem may be retained.”

Jerusalemg was not divided among the tribesh: for the
tradition is, That houses are not hired out at Jerusalem,
because they were no man's own. R. Eleazar Bar Zadok
said, Nor beds also. Therefore‚ the master of the family
