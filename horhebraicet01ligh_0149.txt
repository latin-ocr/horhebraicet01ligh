Pameas. Paneas. 139

the mean time, the fountain of Great Jordan to lie hid, not to
be spoken of, and to be buried in eternal obscurity. What !
· is the less worthy of so much fame3 and. the φθαῖεν, of none
at all? Let us have liberty to speak freely what we think,
with the leave of chorographers.

I. It does not- appear that any other river of Jordan flows
into the lake Samochonitis beside that which ariseth from
Paneas. In what author will you find the least sign of such
a river? But only that such a conjecture crept into the maps,
and into the minds of men, out of the before alleged words of
J osephus, misconceived.

II. We think, therefore, that Jordan is called the Greater
and the Less, not upon any account of two fountains, or two
rivers, different and distant from one another; but upon ac-
count of the distinct greatness of the same river. Jordan,
rising out of Paneas, was called Littlex, until it flowed into
the lake Samochonitis; but afterward coming out of that
lake, when it had obtained a great increase from that lake,
it was thenceforth called Jordan the Greater. Samochonitis
received Little Jordan, and sent forth the Great. For since
both that lake and the country adjacent was very fenny, as
appears out of Josephus,—the lake was not so much in-
creased by Jordan flowing into it, as it increased Jordan
flowing out of it. Κόπτει y τὰ τῆς Σεμεχωνίτιδος λίμνης ἕλη τε
καὶ τέλματα· “Moors and fenny places possess the parts about
the lake Samochonitis.” The river, therefore, below Samo-
chonitis seems to be called ‘Jordan;' above Samochonitis,
‘ Little J ordan.'

Caesarea Philippi was built at Paneas, the fountain of
Jordan: which let the maps observe that they place it not
too remote thence. Φίλιππος πρὸς ταῖς Ἰορδάνου πηγαῖς ἐν
Πανεάδι πόλιν κτίζει Καισάρειαν· “Philipz built the city Cae-
sarea in Paneas, at the springs of J ordan.⁷' And also, Πανεάδα

κατασκευάσας ὀνομάζει Καισάρειαν· “ Havinga finished Paneas,
he named it Oaesarea.”
