Temple, making up the breaches3 and, as Middoth in the
place above speaks, ⁴‘ Those thirteen breaches‚ which the
efficians had made, muru-uma ‘a' mn: iam mia-m ππτη
they repaired ,· and, uecordia-9* to the number qs those breaclzes,
they instituted thirteen adomtimsff'

The altar, because it had been profaned by Gentile sacri-
fices, they pull it wholly down, and lay up the stenes in a
certain chamber near the court.

“ Towardss the north-east there was a certain chamber
where the sons of the Asmoneans laid up the stenes of that
altar, which the Grecian kings had profanedz'’ and that
(as the Book of the Maccabees hath it) μέχρι τοῦ παραγενη-
θῆιάι προφήτην, τοῦ ἀποκριθῆναι περὶ αὐτῶυε “ till there might
come a prophet that should direct them what to do with
them.''

N or (lid it seem without reason : for, whereas those stones
had once been consecrated, they would by no means put them
to any common use ς and since they had been pmfaned, they
durst not put them to any holy use.

The rest of the Temple they restored, purged, repaired,
as may be seen in the places above quoted3 and, on the five-
and-twentieth of the month Oisleu, they celebrated the feast
of the Declicatiou, and established it for an anniversary so—
lemnity, to be kept eight days together. Of the rites of that
feast Ι shall say more in its proper place; and, for the sake
of it, l have been the larger in these things.
