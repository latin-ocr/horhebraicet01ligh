The Lake of Gennesaret, 143

what the word rwmmn& means. Perhaps it is the same
with the word maban& in the A1·uoh,and with niel-mas
in the Babylonian writersn. In whom, the Glosser being inter-
preter, ΠἹἈΚὩἾὮΞΝ ἾΞὶζῇ “are two presidentships in the same
kingdom.” The Gemara affords an example, in *nimi nm:-
But in the Aruch “n-siban& Ἶσ] are two castles, between
which is a bridge, under which notwithstanding is no water-3²
And it yields an example, in ἾἾἾὯΞἾ ”Nl-flu). But we make
no ‘carrying here. ἫἾΞΞἛ Simeabri in the Talmudists is
Σενναβρὶς, Sennabris, in J osephus, being distant from Tiberias
thirty furlongs. For he tells uS, that Vespasian encamped
thirty furlongs from Tiberias, κατάο τινα σταθμὸν εὐσύνοπτον
τοῖς νεωτερίζουσι, Σενναβρὶς ὀνομάζεται, “at a certain station,
that might easily be seen by the innovators, called Sennabris.''
He speaks also of the town Γινναβρὶν, Gimzabrin, not far
distant certainly from this place. For describing the country
about Jordan, heP saith, that from both regions of it runs
out a very long back of mountains, but distant some miles
from the river: on this sicle, from the region of Scythopolis
to the Dead Sea3 on that side, from Julias to Somorrha,
towards the rock of Arabia : and that there lies a plain between,
which is called μέγα πεδίον, ἀπὸ κώμης Γινναβρὶν διῆκον μέχρι
τῆς Ἀσφαλτίτιδος λίμνης· “the great plain, lying along from
the town Gennabrin to the lake Asphaltites.”

The same J osephus writes thus of the lake Gennesaret:
‘Hq δὲ λίμνη Γεννησὰρ ἀπὸ τῆς προσεχοῦς χώρας καλεῖται, στα-
δίων ὃὲ εὖρος οὖσα τεσσαράκοντα, καὶ πρὸς τούτοις ἑτέρων ἑκατὸν
τὸ μῆκος, γλυκεῖά τε ὅμως ἐστὶ καὶ ποτιμωτάτη. “The lake
Gennesar is so called from the adjacent country, being forty
furlongs in breadth, and moreover a hundred in length, it
is both sweet and excellent to drink.’'

Pliny tl1us3-—“Jordan1·, upon the first fall of the valleys,
pours itself into the lake, which many call Genesar, sixteen
miles long and six miles broad.”
