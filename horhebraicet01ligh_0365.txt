The lanyzcaye of Ashdod. 355

5. The lanyuafye ffAslzdod, N eh. xiii. 24, whether the
Samaritam lawaeyuaye or ¹220?

“ Andf the children spake half in the speech of Ashdod,
and could not speak in the J ews' language.'' What language
was this at this time?

I. The Arabian version tells us it was the Chaldee. But
was not the J ewish and the Chaldee tongue at that time all
one? It may be questionable whether it were so “ at that
time or no ;’' but I shall wave that controversy.

II. As to the question in hand, it may not be amiss to
consider that passage, Acts ii. 11: Κρῆτες καὶ Ἄραβες,
“ Cretes and Arabians.” Who are these Cretes? who would
not think, at first sight, that, by the Cretans were meant
the inhabitants of the island ofOrete? I myself have some-
time fallen into this error; but now I should be ready to
say they were the C'lcffl‘etlzim, a Philistine nation and coun-
try. D'D'QD, by the Greek interpreters is rendered Κρῆτες,
Cretes, Ezeksxxv. 16, Zeph. ii. 5, 6: and there is some rea-
son to apprehend that St. Luke, in the place above quoted,
under-stands the same people, because he joins them with the
Arabians.

Observe‚ Ara-bians develliozy in Gerar, a city of the Phi-
listines 3—and it is well enough known that Arabia joins to
the land os the Philistines. And 0110 may suspect the lan-
guage of Ashdod might be the Arabian, rather than the Sa-
maritan tongue; especially when as the name of Idumen.
obtained as far as these places: and was not the Arabio the
language of the Idumeans ἓ

ΙΝ the Samaritam version (that I may still contain myself
within our Chorographical Inquiry), as to the names of
1›laceS‚ there are three things are matter of our notice, and
a fourth of our suspicion.
