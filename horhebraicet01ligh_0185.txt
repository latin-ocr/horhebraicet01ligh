Cana. 1 75

TyrianS, having got together considerable forces, invade
Giscala.’¹ You can scarcely suppose that these Tyrians came
out of Tyre of Phoenicia, but from some other place of the
same name.

Upon that reason that very many towns in the land os
Israel were called by the name of Rama, namely, because
they were seated in some higsh place3 by the same reason
very many are called by the name of *5³2 Tyra, because they
were built in a rocky place.

Cana.

WE have little to certify as to the situation of this place:
only we learn this of Josephus concerning Cana, that it was
such a distance from Tiberias, as he could measure with his
army in one night.. For when word was brought him by
letters, that the enemy Justus had endeavoured to draw

the castle Gcmaalass’ But now, when Julias and Gamala, with-
out all doubt, were beyond Jordan, it may be inquired whe-
ther that Cana were not also on that side. But those things
that follow seem to deny this: for he blocked up the ways,
ὑπὲρ τοῦ τὰς παρὰ τῶν Γαλιλαίων ὠφελείας τοῖς ἐνοίκοις ἀποκλεί-
ειν, “ that by this means he might shut out all supplies that
might come from the G-alileans.” Mark that, that riziyht come
