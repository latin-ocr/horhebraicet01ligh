little city Zoar.

The reasons of the conjecture. besides the agreeableness of
the name, may be especially these two :

I. As Hermonium, or Hermon, was near the springs of
Jordan, so the hilly part of Zoar lay hard by the extreme
parts of Jordan in Asphaltites3 and the Psalmist, speaking

of the land of Jordan, or of the land on the other side of
Jordan, seems to measure out all Jordan from one end to the
other, from the very spring-head to the furthermost part
where the stream ends.

II. As David betook himself to the country on the other
side of Jordan towards Hermon, in his ssight from his son
Absalom, so was it with him, when flying from Saul he
betook himself to Zoar in the land of Moab, 1 Sam. xxii. 3
And so bewails his deplorable condition so much the more
bitterly, that both those times he was banished to the very
utmost oountries, north and south, that the river Jordan
washed.

Isa'. xv. 5.

Wmn the mention of Zoar is this clause subjoined in
Isaiah, 1721233371133 Pil-7:127 Eylatlt Shelo'shzjjah, or “a heifer of
three years old.” So with the mention of Zoar and Horo-
naim, the same clause is also subjoined in Jeremiah.
