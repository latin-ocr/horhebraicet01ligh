5294 Choroqraphical Notes.

Neither, indeed, doth St. Luke say any thing of Perea,
even then when he mentions the tetrarchy of Herod Antipas,
under whose jurisdiction‚ J osephus tells us, were both Perea
and Galilee. Ἐγένετο δὲ ὑπὸ τούτῳ [Ἀντίπᾳ] ἥ τε Περαία καὶ
Γαλιλαία. “ Peread and Galilee were both under AntipaS.”

Why Josephus should not* mention Perea, when he is
speaking of the father’s kingdom, or why St. Luke should
omit it, when he instances the tetrarchy of the son, that being
so unquestionably wit-hin his jurisdiction, Ι confess is some-
thing strange to me ς nor could I pass it without some
remark.

The same J osephus tells us this of the tetrarchy of Philip:
Βαταναία τε καὶ Τράχων, 8ῦο. “ Batanea e, also, and Tracho-
nitis, Auranitis and some parts of Zeno's house, about J am-
nia, yielding the profits of one hundred talents, were under
Philip’s government.'' And again, Τότε δὴ καὶ Φίλιππος τε-
λευτᾷ τὸν βίον, εἰκοστῷ μὲν ἐνιαυτῷ τῆς Τιβερίου ἀρχῆς. “ Thenf
died Philip, in the twentieth year of the reign of Tiberius,
when he himself had governed for seven-and-thirty years
over Trachonitis, Gaulonstis, and the country of the Bata-
neans.'' Here we see Auranitis is not mentioned, but Gau-
lonitis is; and in St. Luke, neither Batanea, nor Gaulonitis,
nor Auranitis; but, instead of them, Iturea. There is a
chronological difficulty& in these words of Josephus‚ which
is not easily solved3 but this is not the business of this
treatise.

It is hard to say whether this Ζήνωνος οἶκος, house of
Zenon, have any relation with Zenodorus the robber. J ose-
phus, in the place above quoted ¹³, mentions him, saying, that
Augustus was the more willing to put Batanea, Trachonitis,
and Auranitis, under the government of Herod the Gmat,
that he might the more effectually suppress the thefts and
rapines committed by one Zenodorus and the Trachonites.
Straboi also speaks of this Zenodorus, telling us, that “ there
were few robberies committed now; καταλυθέντων τῶν περὶ
Ζηνόδωρον τῶν λῃστῶν, the robbers of Zenodorus's party being)
cut off.”
