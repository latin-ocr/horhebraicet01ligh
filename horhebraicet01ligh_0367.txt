The situation of mounts Gerizim <md Εὐαί. 357

‘ Euphrates’ as washing some place called ⁶ Salmaah.’ Pto-
lemy‚ in his chapter concerning the situation of Arabia
Deserta, mentions Sannai, in degr. 78. 20. 28. 30: and it is
numbered amongst six-and-twenty other cities, which he
saith are ἐν τῇ μεσογείᾳ, which the Latin interpreter translates
⁶ Juxta Mesopotamia1n‚' ⁴ near Mesopotamia.' If this be true,
the Samaritan version hath something by which it may de-
fend itself : for if those cities mentioned by Ptolemy were
indeed ‘ Juxta Mesopotamiam,' ‘ near Mesopotamia' (the river
Euphrates only running between), then may the Samaritan
version be warranted while it renders “ even to the river Eu-
ph1·ateS,” ‘⁶ even to the river of Salmaah,’' that is, “ to the
river Euphrates in that place where it wash'eth the sides of

Salma.''

THAT Sychar is the same place with Sychem, seems be-
yond doubt3 which, indeed, the mount Gerizim pointed to
by the Samaritam woman, sufficiently confirms. A wily ar-
gument, perhaps, in Epiphanius's esteem, who, in his Sama-
ritan heresy‚ gives us this account :

Τῷ γὰρ βουλομένῳ ἀκριβῶς περὶ τοῦ ὅρους Γαριζεὶν ἐρευνᾶσθαι,
ἰστέον ὅτι πρὸς τῇ Ἰεριχῷ κεῖνται τὰ δύο ὅρη, τό τε τοῦ Γαριζεὶν
καὶ τὸ τοῦ Γεβὰλ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, πρὸς τῇ ἀνατολῇ τῆς Ἰεριχῶ,
ὡς ἔχει τὸ Δευτερονόμιον, καὶ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Ναυῆ ἡ βίβιλος· “ There
are two mounts near Jericho beyond Jordan, Gerizim and
Ebal, which look towards J ericho on the east,'' &c So that,
we see, he tells us Gerizim and Ebal were near J ericho, not
near Sychem. So also before him, Eusebius ‘de Locis He-
bramis? at least, if he be the author of that book, as Petavius ·
noteth.

That clause 37:252 ‘vm “over-against Gilgal,” Deut. xi. 30,
hath deceivcd these authors in that manner, that they have
removed the mounts Gerizim and Ebal to Gilgal by J ericho :
and it hath, on the other hand, deceivcd some in that manner,
that they have brought Gilgal by Jericho to Sychem, mis-
understanding the word Gilyal sor that place mentioned in
