Mention is made of a certain temple in Ascalon among
the “ fiveg more famous templeS,-—x⁷i2. the temple of Bel in
Babylon, the temple of Nebo in Cursi, of Tiratha in Mapheg‚
of Zeripha in Ascalon, and of N ishra in Arabia.”

And there is a story of a fast enjoined, because some sign
appeared of a blast of the corn in Ascalon: “The h elders
went down from Jerusalem into their cities, and enjoined a
fast, because so much of a blast was seen in Ascalon, as the
space of the mouth of an oven may contain.'’

But· most famous of all is the story of the eighty women,
that were witches, hanged by Simeon Ben Shetach in one
and the same day. We will not think much to relate the
thing in the words of the Ge1na1·istsi:-“· When as two dis-
ciples of the wise men 111 Ascalon werek intent upon the
study of the law, one of them, at length dying, had no fune-
rals performed for him,—when yet a publican, dying at that
time, had. To the student, that survived, are revealed the

the damned publiean.” &Wzvn ΞἿῙὮΞΞ ”³737 ΠΣ DUX) &72er

those things? it- was answered, Until Simon Ben Shetach
came to supply her place. But, said he, for what crime? It
is answered, Therefore, because 116 sometime swore against
his soul, and said, If Ι shall ever become a prince, I will de-
stroy all wizards. But behold, he is become a priuce, and
yet he hath not done this: for eighty women, that are witches,
lie hid in a cave at Ascalon, and kill the world. Go, aud tell
