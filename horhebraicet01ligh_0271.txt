called by Mark Ἑλληνὶς Συροφοίνισσα, ⁶ a Syrophoenician
Greek,' which is without all scruple; but when she is called
Χαναναία, ⁶ a Canaanitish wm11a11‚” by Matthew, that is
somewhat obscure. If those things which in our animad-
versions upon Matthew we have said upon that place do
not please any, let these things be added: 1. That Oanaan
and Phoenicia are sometimes convertible terms in the Seventy‚
Joshua iv, 1, 12, &a 2. If Ι should say that Ἑλληνὶς, α
Greek· woman, and Χαναναία, a anzaam'tisk woman, were
also convertible terms, perhaps it may be laughed at3 but it
would not be so among the Jews, who call all men-servants
and women-servants, not of Hebrew blood, Canaanites. It
is a common distinction, “5237 ‘1237 a Hebrew servant, and
”3723 '1237 a Oanaanite sermm,- and so in the feminine sex.
But now α Canaanite servant, say they, is a servant of any
nation besides the Hebrew nation. Imagine this woman>
to be such, and there is nothing obscure in her name: be-
cause she was a servant-woman of a heathen stock, and.
thence commonly known among the Jews under the title
1⁸3³]le rtrum* of a Oa‘tzaam'te woman-servam.
