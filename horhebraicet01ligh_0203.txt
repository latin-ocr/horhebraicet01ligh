Of the places of Burial. 193

[ver. 12]‚ Peter ran to the sepulchre h, and, when he had
stooped down, he saw the linen-clothes ;'' that is, the women,
and Peter after them, standing in the floor (nm-m), bow
down their faces, and look downward into the place where
the sepulchres themselves were (ΓΞὈΠ ΠἾΞΠΞΒ the cave of the
yraves), which, as we said before, was four cubits deeper than
the floor.

John xx. 5: “ The disciple whom J esus loved came first
to the sepulchre 3 and when he had stooped down’' (stand-
ing in the floor, that he might look into the burying-place),
“ saw the linen clothes lie 3 yet went he not in. But Peter
went in‚'' &c.; that is, from the floor he went down into the
cave itself, where the rows ofthe yraves (3³:52) were (in which,
nevertheless‚ no corpses had been as yet laid, besides the
body of Jesus): thither also after Peter, John goes down.
And ver. 11⁰. ‘⁵ But Mary, weeping, stood at the sepulchre
without: and while she wept, she stooped down to the se-
pulchre, and saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head,
and another at the feet, where the body of Christ had lain.”

“ She stood at the sepulchre without ;'' that is, within
the cave, on the floor, but without that deeper cave, where
the very graves were, or ΓΞἹΞ the places for the bodies .· bow-
ing herself, to look down thither, she saw two angels at the
head and foot of that ἼὉ cqffin wherein the body of Christ
had been laid.
