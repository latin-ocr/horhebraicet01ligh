to it, out of N eh. iii. 1), or, at least, Bethesda, was near the
Temple. Consult the commentators, and they almost all
agree in this opinion. With their good leave, let it not be
amiss to interpose these two or three things :

I. That no part of the outward wall of the city (which
this Skeep-qate was) could be so near the Temple, but that
some part of the city must needs lie between. Betwixt the
north gates and the Temple, Zion was situated ς on the west,
was part of Zion and Millo 3 on the south, Jerusalem, as it is
distinguished from Zion 3 on the east, the east street, whose
gate is not the Slzeep-yate, but the WVater-gate.

H. The Προβατικὴ πύλη, the ›S'lzeep-yate, according to Ne-
hemiah's description, should be situated on the south u wall
of the city, not far from the corner that pointed south-east;
eo that a considerable part of Jerusalem lay betwixt the
Temple and this gate. .

We have elsewhere made it plain that Sion was situated
on the north part of the city, contrary to the mistake of the
tables, which place it on the south. Now, therefore, consi-
der to how great an extent the wall must run before it can
come to any part of Zion ; to wit, to the stairs that go down
⁴from the city of David, ver. 15, which were on the west ; and.
thence proceed to the sepulchres of David, ver. 163 till it
come at length to the x &vater-gate, and Ophel towards the
east, ver. 26: and thence to the corner near which is the
›S'lceep-gyate, ver. 31, 323 and this will plainly evince that
the description and progress in Nehemiah is, first, of the
south wall, from the Slceep-qoefic to the west eorner; then
of the west wall 3 and so to the northern and the eastern;
which makes it evident that the Sheep-gmte is on the south
wall, a little distant from the corner which looks south-east,
which could not but be a considerable distance from the
Temple, because no small part of Jerusalem, as it was dis-
tinguiSlied from Zion, laid between.
