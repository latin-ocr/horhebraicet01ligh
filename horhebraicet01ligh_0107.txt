The country of J ericho. 97

ἀρδείας λιπαρώτατη, παρὰ τὴν παλαιὰν ἀναβλύζουσα πόλιν, διο.
“ Near Jericho Γ is a very plentiful spring, and very rich for
waterings and moistening the ground3 it riseth near the
old city, and J esus the son of Nave took it. Of which spring
there is a report, that, in former times, it did not only make
the fruits of the earth and of the trees to decay, but also the
offspring of women3 and was universally unwholesome and
harmful to all: bnt it was changed into a better condition
by Elizeus, ὅτε. (see 2 Kings ii. 21). So that those waters,
which before were the cause of barrenness and famine, did
thenceforth produce fruitfulness and abundance: and they
have so greatt a virtue in their watering, that whatsoever
place they touch, they bring on to a very speedy ripeness.”

Καὶ πεδίου μὲν ἕπεισιι) ἑβδομήκοντα σταδίων μῆκος, εὖρος δὲ
εἴκοσιν· “ And they overflow the plain seventy furlongs in
length, and twenty in breadth : and there they nourish very
fair and thick gardens of palm-trees of divers kinds, &a
That place also seeds bees, and produceth opobalsamum, and
cyprinum, and myrobalanum: so that one might not call it
amiss Θεῖου τὸ χωρίον, ‘ a divine e‹›untry,'” &o

strabon speaks like things, Ἰεριχοὺς δέ ἐστι πεδίου κύκλῳ
περιεχόμενον ὀρεινῇ τινι, &c. “ .J ericho is a plain surrounded
with mountains, which in some places bend to it after the
manner of a theatre. A grove of palm-trees is there, with
which are mixed also other garden plantS, a fruitful place,
abounding with palm-trees for the space of a hundred fur-
longs, all well watered, and full of habitatione. The royal
court and paradise of balsan] is there,'’ &c.

And PlinyX3 ‘³ J ericho, planted with groves of palms, and
well watered with springs,'' Sec.

Hence the city is called, the ‘⁴ city of palm-trees,'' Dent.

brew, is [ἸἾἾᾮΠΓ] ἺἾᾫᾨ, From the city of palm-trees, the
