tradition. Abba Chalaphtha of Caphar Hananiah, in the
name of R. Meir, saith,'' [they are in Bavah Mezia, where he
is brought in, and what he said‹1]‚ 7²22 ζΦΠ ΠἾΞἎΠ ’ἾΞΒ *³2 37⁰„
ΠΞΞ “ It seems to me³³ (they are the words of the author of
J uchasin) ‘⁶ that Caphar Hananiah is Caphar Cana; as may
be proved out of the ninth chapter of the book Sheviith: for
there was the entrance of the Lower Galilee.”

From that place, quoted in Sheviith‚ which is Hal. 2, it
plainly appears that Caphar Hananiah was in the very out-
most border that divided the Upper and the Lower Galilee.
From whence it is evideant, that the entrance of the Lower
GaHIee, according to our author, was not as we go from
Samaria to Galilee, but from the Upper Galilee into the
Lower. And whether our Cana of Galilee be so called to
distinguish it from that Cana that so divides between the
two Galilees, 01· from that Cana that was in the tribe of Asher
(which may not unfitly be called ‘ Cana of the Sidonians⁷)‚ it
is at the reader's choice to determine s. As also, why the
Syriac interpreter should in this place write &lap Katna, in-
stead of ‘ Cana' W'hether he had in his eye or mind ,ΠΤ-ΙΨ
Asanam, J osh. xix. 15, which, in the vulgar dialect, was called
Κατανὰθ, Katamana, as the Seventy render it, and the J eru-
salem Talmudists affirms; or whether by a diminutive kind
of word &lup Katanalz, he would intimate the smallness of
the town: q. d. “ Cana the Less.''
