Eminent buildinys in Sion. 51

whole earth is mount Sion, on the north side.'' Where Aben
Ezra hath this note3 ΕΞῘὩΨΤῚἾ ἶἾΞΣζΞ, ἲἸἾζ “ Mount Sion is on
the north side of Jerusalem :'' and Lyranus, ‘⁶ Mouut Sion is
in the north part of J erusalem.'’ The Seventy, ’Όρη Σιῶυ τὰ

πλευρὰ τοῦ βορρᾶ· “ The mountains of Sion on thc sides of thc

north.'’
Οὕρεά τοι Σιῶνος ἀπὸ πλευρῆς βορεάο,
Sion’s fair hills stand on cold Boreas' coast.
Apollinar. [Metaphr. Ps.]

ΙΙ. When the prophet Ezekiel takes a prospect of the new
Jerusalem in a vision‚-—he saith, that he stood upon “ a very
high mountain, near which was, as it were, the building of
a city on the south‚” Ezek. xl. 2. On which place Kimchi
thus; “ He placed me upon a very lofty mountain. That
mountain was the Mount of the Temple : for the Temple was
to be built in a mountain, as before. And the city Jerusalem
is near it on the south.'⁷ And Lyranus again, after thc re-
citing the explication of some upon that verse, and his re-
Jecting it; ‘⁶ And therefore (saith he) the Hebrews say, and
better, as it seems, that the prophet saw two things,—namely‚

the city and the Temple‚-ancl that the Temple was in the
north part,—-but the city in the south part.’'

Behold! reader‚ Zion on the north part in the Psalmz'st,
and the city on the south part in the prophet !

Thec things which make for this in J osephus are various,
and plain enough; which nevertheless we cannot frame into
arguments, before the buildings of better note in Sion, 01· 111
the Upper City, be viewed :--of which the reader must be
mindful 3 namely, that the name of Sion, after the return out
of Babylon, was grown into disuse‚-but the morc vulgar
was, τῆς ἄνω ἀγορᾶς, the Upper Town.
