have a hundred pieces‘? indeed, where should I have three 3’
Immediately the holy blessed God procured five angels, in
the likeness of men, who offer him for five shillings to con-
vey the stone into Jerusalem, if himself would but give his
helping hand. He gave them a lift; and of a sudden they
all stood in J crusalem3 and when he would have given them
the reward they bargained for, his workmen were gone and
vanished. This wonder he relates before the Sanhedrim, in
the conclave of Gazith. They say to him, ‘ Rabbi, it should
