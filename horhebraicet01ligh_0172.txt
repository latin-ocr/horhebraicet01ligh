162 Ohoroyraplzz’cal century.

“ Kitronz (Judg. i. 29, 30) is Tsippor: and why is it called
ἾῚΞΒ Tsippor ,9 Because it is seated upon a mountain 5³52:
as Tsimwr, a bird.''

“ Sixteena miles on all sides from Tsippor was a land flow-
ing with milk and honey.”

This city is noted in J osephus for its warlike affairs3 but
most noted in the Talmudists for the university fixed there,
and for the learning, which Rabbi Judah the Holy brought
hither, as we have said before. Heb sat in this place seven-
teen years, and used most frequently to say this of himself,
‘⁶ Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and Judah lived in
Tsippor seventeen years.''

Hec sat also in Beth-Shaarim, as also in Tiberias, but he
ended his life in Tsippor. There is this story of his death;
“ Thed men of Tsippor said, W hosoever shall tell us that
Rabbi is dead, we will kill him. Bar Kaphra, having his
head veiled, looked upon them and said, ‘Holy men and
angels both took hold of the tables of the covenant, and the
hand of the angels prevailed, and they snatched away the
tables? They said to him, ‘ Is Rabbi dead 3’ He said, ‘ ΥΘ
have said.' They rent their garments after that manner,
that the voice of the renting came as far as Papath, that is,
the space of three miles. R. Nachman in the name of R. Mena
said, ⁶ Miracles were done on that day.’ When all cities were
gathered together to lanient him, and that on the eve of the
sabbath, the day did not waste, until every one was gone
home, had filled a bottle with water, and had lighted up a
sabbath-candlc. The Rath Kol pronounced blessedness upon
those that lamented him, cxcepting only one, who knowing
himself excepted, threw himself headlong from thc roos, and
died.

“R. ‚Judahe died in Tsippor, but his burial was in Both-
Shaarim : dying, hc gave in command to his son, ‘ When ye
carry mc to my burial, (1ο not lament nle in the small citios
through whichf yc shall pass, but in tho g1·eat,”'' &c. What
