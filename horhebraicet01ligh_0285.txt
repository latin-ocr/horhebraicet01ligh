Ono. · 275

citizen oftlce city of Ono, eminent among the Rabbius, “ one
of the five learned who judged before the wise men. These
were Ben Azzai, Ben Zuma„ Chanan, and Chananiah, and
Ben Nanas.'‘

Why the maps placed Lod and Ono near Jordan, not far
from J ericho, I can meet with no other reason than that in
J osephus is found the town Adida, not far from thence, and
Hadid is reckoned with Lod and Ono in Ezra ii. 33; and Lod
and Hadid are framed intoZ one word Λοὸαδὶ, Lodaslz', ΕΖΗ),
ii. 33, and Λοδαὸὶδ, Locladid, Neh. vii. 37, by the Seventy in-
terpreters. But there were more places called by the name of
Adida3 so that that reason faiis, if that were the reason. For
there was Ἀδιδᾶ ἐν τῇ Σεφήλᾳ, ‘ Adida in SepheL' (⁴ Adida in
the valley);' anda, Ἀδιὸἂ πόλις ἐπ’ ὄρους κειμένη, “The city
Adida in the mountain; ὑφ’ ἧς ὑπόκειται τὰ τῆς Ἰουδαίας πεδία·
under which lie the plains of Judea.” And b ‘⁶ Adida in
Galilee before the great plain,'’ isc it were not the same with
“ Adida ἐν τῇ Σεφήλᾳ, in Seplael.''

Of Lydda, which we are now near when we are speaking
of Ono, let that be considered, for the sake of young students,
which the Gloss adviseth(¹‚ That Lydda is called also {svp-5¹1³?
Lodicea ,· and frequent mention is made of 7537] ῸἻἽΠ “ the
martyrs in Lydda,” which is sometimes also pronounced
ΝῬἾἸῘὩΞ 'mm-v ‘⁴ the martyrs in Lodiceas' as in that storye
among other places3 “ When the tyrant [or Trery'an] endea-
voured to kill Lolienus [perhaps Jubianus] and Papus his
brother &³377'3372 in Lodieea, &c.'' [the (Nossa-Ul? ΝἾΠ &nv-15³7
Lodicea, that is, Lydda] “ he said to them, If you are of the
people of Ananias, Michael, and Azarias, let your God corne,
and deliver you out of my hand.”

The martyrdom of these brethren is much celebrated, which
they underwent for the king's daughter, who was found
slain; and the enemies of the Jews said that the Jews had
slain her; and these brethren‚ to deliver Israel, said, ⁶ We
slew her ς’ therefore those alone the king slew. So the
Gloss.

In the tract Kelims there is mention of ῬἾἾῘὩ t7‘ffifl2,which
