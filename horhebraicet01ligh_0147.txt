the Jerusalem writers say, ‘⁶ Theyk built for the daughters of
the Midianites little booths of hurdles from Beth-Jeshimon

unto the mountain of snow, and placed there women selling
cakes.”

The Jerusalem Targum upon Num. xxxv. writes thus;

‘⁶ The mountain of snow at Caesarea” (Philippi). See also
J onathan there.

ῦἾὛ-ὛΞ Pamias. Paneas, the sprz‘nq of Jordan.

THE maps assign a double spring of J ordan; but by what
right it scarce appearsg much less does it appear by what
right they should call this J0r,—and that Dan. There is
indeed mention in J osephus of little Jordan and great Jor-
dan. Hence, as it seems, was the first original of the double
spring in the maps, and of a double river at those first springs.
For thus Jose13hus; Πηγαὶ, αἲ τὸν μικρὸν καλούμενον Ἰορδάνην

Riblah (that we may note this by the way) by the Tar-
gumists is rendered Daphne. They, upon Num. xxxiv. ΙΙ,
for that which is in the Hebrew, “And the border shall go
down to Riblah,” render it, “ And the border shall go down
to Daphne.” See also Aruch in *³:²27 Daphne. But this cer-
tainly is not that Daphne of which J osephus here speaks,

which will sufficiently appear by those things that follow.
But as to the thing before us :—

I. Both he and the Talmudists assign Panium or Paneas
to be the spring of J ordan3 nor do they name another.
