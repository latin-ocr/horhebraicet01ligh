Division qf the land. 7

of their religion were to be handled nowhere but within
these limits. Fore besides the rites of that dispensatim,
which the Holy Scripture doth openly and evidently fix to
that land, such as Sacrifices, Passovers, the Priesthood f, and
other appointments of that nature (which are commonly, and
not improperly‚ called ΫἾΝΞ, ΠἸἾἸΚἩἾ mm (“Statutes ap-
pendant to that land”)‚ very many others also are circum-
scribed within the same borders by the fathers of the tra-
ditioris.

“ The land of Israel (say theyg), above all other lands‚ is
sanctified by ten holinesses And what is the holiness of it?

And that I heap not together more, they do, in a manner,
circumscribe the Holy spirit himself within the limits of that
land. For ·'‘ Shechinah (say theyk) dwells not upon any out of
the land.” Compare Acts x, 45.

The land, which the Jews, that came up out of Babylon,
possess, they divide after this manner :—

“ There1 are three lands (or countries), s’x'fflw& Umlvm—
Judea‚ the land beyond Jordan, and Galilee3 and each of
those have three countries :''—those we shall take notice of
in their places. To this received division our Saviour hath
respect, when, sending his disciplcs to preach to 1110 “ lost
sheep of lsrael,'' he excludes Samaria, Matt. x. 53 which,
