Bathara laid waste. lt was a custom, that when an infant
male was born, they planted a cedar 3 when an infant female,
a pine; and, when the children contracted marriage, out of
those trees they made the bride-chamber. On a certain day

And y when they took it, they slew the men, the women, and
the children, so that their blood flowed into the great sea.
You will say, perhaps, that it was near the sea; but it was

two parts water. It was delivered also, that the heathen
gathered the vintages, for the space of seven years, without
dunging the land, because the vineyards were made fruitful
enough by the blood of the Israelites.”

The Jerusalem writers do hyperbolize enough coneerning

they) that it was near the sea, was it not distant forty miles?
They say, that three hundred skulls of young children were
found upon one stone: and that there were three chosts of
torn phylacteries, each chest containing nine bushels: but
there are others that say, nine chests‚ each containing three
bushels.''
