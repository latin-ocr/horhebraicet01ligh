M ozmt Olivet. 89

they cannot but believe some such thing of that mount. R.
Janua saith f, ΠΠὉῖΖ] “ lee Divina& IlIajesty stood three years
and a half in mount Olivet, and preached, saying‚ ‘ Seek ye
the Lord, while hc may be found3 call upon him, while he
is near.'”

And now let us from this mountain look back upon the
city. Imagine yourself sitting in that place, where the priest
stood, while he burnt the red cow, directly over against the
east gate of the Temple. Between the mount and the city
you might see a valley running between, compassing Sion
on the right hand, and Jerusalem on the left: the Gate of
Waters against you, leading to the Temple3 on the left
hand, Ophla and the Horse-gate. From thence, as we have
said, was the beginning of the valley of Hinnom, which, at
length, bowed towards the south side of the city. In that
place, near the wall, was the Fullers' field 3 which whether
it was so called from wood framed together, where fullers
dried their cloth; or ἀπὸ κναφέως μνήματος, ‘ from a fuller’s
monument? of which Josephus ἢ writes,—we do not dispute.

From the Horse-gate, westward, runs out the valley Ke-

dron, in which is a brock, whence the valley takes its name
—embracing Sion also on the north, and spreading abroad
itsels in a more spacious breadth.
· ‘⁶ Belowi the city, there was a place’' (we do not dare to
mark it out) “which was called &Em Motza: hither they
came down” (in the feast of Tabernacles) ‘⁶ and cropped off
thence long boughs of willow’' (it may be, from the banks of
the brock Kedron); ‘⁶ and, going away, placed them near
the sides of the altar‚——bended after that manner, that their
heads might bow over the top of the altar,” &c.

It is no marvel, if thcre were a multitude of gardens
without the city, when there were none within. Among them
“ a ¹< garden of Jerusalem is famed, wherein figs grew, which
were sold for three 01· four assarii each : and yet neither the
Truma, nor the Tenth, was ever taken of the1n.“'
