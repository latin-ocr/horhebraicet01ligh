Whilst we are in this watery country, are we not got
amongst the rivers of Arnon? The learned Beza commenting
upon those words Of St. John iii. 23, ὅτι ὕδατα πολλὰ ἣν ἐκεῖ,
“for there was much water there‚'' affirms it. commenting
thus: “ Multi videlicet rivi, quorum etiam in eo tractu circa
Aroer fit mentio in libris Mosis;’' ‘¹ namely, many rivers, of
which also in that tract about Aroer there is mention in the
books of Moses.” And the situation of the place confirtns it;
when as Machaerus was the very utmost bounds of the ⁶ land
of Israel ’ towards Moab, according to J osephus, as also was
Arnon according to Moses

But here we find no place that is called either AEnon οι·
Salim. True, indeed3 but the place, for the very wateriness
of it, deserves to be called AEozon, that is, a place of
sprinys ,· and if Salina may be the same with Salamara,
here we have also the Kenite or Salamean, Gen. xv. [19.] and
Numb. xxiv. [22] However, in a thing so very obscure, it is
safest not to be positive; and the reader's candour is begged
in this modest way of conjecturing. The way we tread is

unbeaten, and deserves a guide, which as yet we have not
obtained.

notice of what we meet with in Borchard and others, con-

tell), as also that ἾᾎΒὮ ἾΓῙ the hill Mizaar, is rendered

that it is mount Hermon: it seems plainly to be the ⁶ hilly

of time might have pcrmittcd him, Gen. xix. 20: “ O‘l let inc
