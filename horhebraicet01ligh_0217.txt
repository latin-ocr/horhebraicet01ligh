lee southern country of Judea. 5207

SEc'r. VIL—Tke whole southern country of Judea within
Idumea.

I⁷r swallowed up also the whole country of south Judea,
which was more generally marked out by two names, ΝῺἹἾἾ

So that when the Holy Scripture divides the south of
Judea from Idumea, Num. xxxiv, and Josh. xv,—we must
know that dividing line now is broken, and all the south of
J udea is called Idumea. But here, by the way, I cannot but
note the Arabio interpreter, who renders Edom, in Josh. xv. ι,
by :nn ³7& Rome s--by what authority let himself look to it;
so let the Jews do too, who commonly call the ‘Romans,’
‘ Edomites?

How much this New Idumea ehot itself into J udea is not
to be defined3 since it admitted indeed no limits‚ but where
either the force or fraud of that nation could not thrust itself
in farther. If you betake yourself to Josephus, here and
there speaking of that nation, you would think that it ex-
tended almost as far as Hebron. Thence, perhaps, were
those endeavours of some, of <1 freeing the hill-country of
J udea from tithing. Of which endeavour we can scarce con-
ceive another reason, than that that country was now too
much turned heathen, and tithes should not be taken from
heathens. For these Idumeans were but a remove from hea-
then : they had passed into the J ewish rites; but they were
neither friends to the Jews nor to their religion.
