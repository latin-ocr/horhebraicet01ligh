Smer. V.—Of the sabbatio river.

WHEN we are speaking of Syrophoenieia, we are not far
off from a place where the sabbatio river either was, or was
feigned to be: and Ι hope the reader will pardon me, if I
now wandel· a little out of my bounds, going to see a river
that kept the sabbath : for who would not go out of his way
to see so astonishing a thing?

And yet, if we believe Pliny, we are not without our bounds,
for he fixeth this river within Judea. ‘⁶ In Judea (saith he0)
a river every sabbath day is (lry.''——-Josephus otherwise ,;
“ Titus (saith he Ρ, going to Antioch) saw in the way a river
very well worthy to be taken notice of, between the cities of
Arca and Raphana, cities of the kingdom of Agrippa. Now
it hath a peculiar nature. For, when it is of that nature, that
it flows sreer, and does not sluggishly glide away; yet it
wholly fails from its springs for six days, and the place of it
appears dry. And then, as is no change at all were made,
on the seventh day the like river ariseth. And it is by eer-
tain experienee found that it always keeps this order. whence
it is called the ‘ sabbatio rivel-,² from the holy seventh day of
the Jews.”

Xthether of the two do you believe, reader? Pliny saith,
That river is in Judea: Josephus saith, No. Pliny saith, It
is dry on sabbath days: J osephus saith, It flows then. The
Talmudists agree with Pliny; and Josephus agrees not with
his own countrymen.
