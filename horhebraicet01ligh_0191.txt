namely, because it was seated in some woody place. For
such places the land of Nephthali was famous above the
other tribes: to which the words of Jacob have regard,
“ Nephthali is a hind let loose,'’ Gen. xlix, [21]; that is,
Nephthali shall abound with venison3 as Asher (of whom
mention is made in the words going before) shall abound in
bread, and royal dishes. Those words also of the Talmudists
refer to this, “ Itm is lawful for cattle to feed in common,
*mm mm rrum* mxv ³5³2& pum-nrm in me woods,
yea, for tlae tribe ofJudalz [to seed] in tlze tribe ‹ffNephtlzali.”
Hence ‘ Harosheth of the Gentiles' hath its name, J udg. iv. 2,
which was in that tribe. Led by these reasons, I suppose
our Chorazin to have been in Gahlee, rather than in Perea,
where most maps place it.

But when this place seems to have been so famous for the
frequent presence and miracles os Christ, it is a wonder that
it hath nowhere else so much as a mention in the gospel-
story, but in the bare remembrance of it in those words of
Christ, “ Woe to thee, Chorazin‚'' &c.; whereas Bethsaida
and Capernaum, places that he mentioneth with it, are
spoken of elsewhere. What if, under this name, Cana be
concluded‚ and some small country adjacent, which, from its
situation in a wood, might be named ‘ Chorazin,' that is, ⁴ the
woody country 3' Cana is famous for the frequent presence
and miracles of Christ. But away with conjecture, when it
grows too bold.

IN the place cited, discourse is had about the tithing of
some herbs and seeds, nalnely, of rice, nuts, onions, Egyp-

of tithing them, if they grow in places which seem to be
without the land3 and these words are presently after
