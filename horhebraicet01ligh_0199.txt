the countryman within bounds, that he could not plough nor
mow his land according to his own will, but according ‘to the
rule of tradition. ’

“ Thes inhabitants of Beth-Namer measured out a corner
for the poor with a line, and they gave a corner out of every
row. Abba Saul saith, They make mention of them to their
praise, and to their dispraise : to their dispraise‚ because
they gave one part out of a hundred; to their praise, because,
measuring with a line, they collected and gave a corner out
of every row:” that is, meeting with a measuring line, they
yielded the hundredth part of the field to the poor, and that
out of every row of sheaves.

Szcbterraneous places. illimes. Caves.

Tuus having taken some notice of the superficies of the
land, let us a little search into its bowels. You may divide
the subterraneous country into three parts : the metal mines,
the caves, and the places of burial.

This land was eminently noted for metal mines, so that
“ its stones,” in very many places, “ were iron, and out of its
hills was digged brass‚” Deut. viii. 9. From these gain ac-

and misery; being frequently condemned hither by tyrants.
So Eusebius of Edesius, Τοῖς κατὰ Παλαιστίνην δέδοται με-
τάλλοιςῖ, “ He was condemned to the metal mines of Pales-
tine.'' And again, concerning others, Εἶτ’ ἐπὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς
μεταβὰς ὁμολογητὰς, τοῖς κατὰ Φαινὼ τῆς Παλαιστίνης χαλκοῦ
μετάλλοις τοὺς πάντας παραδίδωσιν· “ Then u passing to the
other confessors of Christ, he condemns them all to the brass
mines, which were in Pheno of Palestine.''

On the north part of the land, in the country of Asher,
were mines of metal. Hence is that in Deut. xxxiii. 25,
“ Thy shoes shall be iron and brass.” On the south, in the
desert of Sin, the utmost bounds of Judea, were mines also :
