The reyion qf Decapole's. 251

⁴ For perhaps one of the other days is the sabbath.'] R. Aki-
bah answered‚ ΠὉἾἿ ῙἾἾΔΞΒ ἾΠΞ lee Sabbatio river will
prove this. ΓἹἛΠἼ :m ‘72’1 He that harh α python, (or a
familiar spirit.) will prove this. N'Dss' 5³2& ‘7127' ἹἾΞΡἾ And
tlte sepulchre of his faclcer will prove tlzis.'' The Gloss writes
thus: “ ' The Sabbatie river will prove this? That is a rocky
river, which flows and glides all the days of the week, but
ceaseth and resteth on the sabbath. ‘ He that hath a python
or a familiar spirit, will prove this? For a python ascendeth
not on the sabbath-day. And the sepulchre of Turnus Rufus,
all the days of the year, sent forth a smoke 3 because he
was judged and delivered to fire. But transgressors in hell
rest on the sabbatli-day.” Therefore‚ his sepulchre sent not
forth a smoke on the sabbath day.

Do you not suspect. reader, whence and wherefore this
fable was invented? namely, when the brightness of the
Christian sabbath was now risen, and increased every day,
they had recourse to these monsters either of magio or of
fables, whereby the glory of our sabbath might be obscured,
and that of the Jews exalted. The various, and indeed con-
trary relations of historians bring the truth of the story
into suspicion.

WE meet with frequent mention of Decapolis in the evan-
gelists, as also in foreign authors; but no where in a more
difficult sense than in those words of St. Mark, chap. vii,
where it is thus spoken of Christ; Καὶ πάλιν ἐξελθὼν ἐκ τῶν
ὁρίων Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος, ἦλθε πρὸς τὴν θάλασσαν τῆς Γαλι-
λαίας, ἀνὰ μέσον τῶν ὁρίων Δεκαπόλεως· “ And again depart-
