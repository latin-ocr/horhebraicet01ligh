Ephraim. 109

τὰς μεσαιτάτας τῆς Ἰδουμαίας; “ Betaris‚ and Cephartobas,
two midland towns of Idumea :”—where by Idumea he means
the southern part of J udea, especially that that was moun-
tainous: as appears by the context. He calls Idumea, pro-
perly so called, Μεγάλην Ἰδουμαίαν, “ Idumea the Great.'’

OHAP. LIII.
ΞἿἾΞὩ, Ephraim.

WE mean not here the land of Ephraim, but a certain
town in the confines of that land: of which you read 2 Chron.
xiii. ¹9³; and of which the Talinudic writers speakb: ‘⁶ What
is the best flour,'' to be offered in the Temple? ‘⁶ Michmas
and Mezonechah obtain the first place for fine flour3 ΠἻἛΨ
*mpla 'CDWD'L' 'CM-5³²) Ephraim in the valley obtains the next
place to them.'’ These words are not read the same way
by all.

Those of the Mishnaioth‚ in the eighth chapter, read, as we
have writ it: the Tosaphtah also reads DDZD Mefclmms .· but
the Talmud ΠΕἲἾ Dum: the Aruch also hat-h 0⁸:32, Mich-
masc: but for ΠΠἾὊὯ ῘΙΙθεοηεσίιαῘι, it hath ΠὌῖ Ζαηοαᾶ.
The same also read ΕἯἾΞῺ, with the letter y (Ain) z the Tal-
mud ΒἾἾἾἾΞΨ Ephorav'm: the Gloss saith, tarnim> ‘⁶ Epho-
raim is a city, of which it is thus written in the books of the
Chronicles, ‘ And Abijah took DW‘iDy Ephraim) '⁵

The Gemarists read it after the same manner. ΕἾἾἾΞῺ

Πωζὶῖῖ “ J annes and Mambres said to Moses, Do you bring
straw into Ephraim {⁵⁵ Which the Aruch reciting‚ adds these
words3 “ There was a city in the land of Israel, very fruit-
ful in bread-corn, called Ephraim ε when Moses therefore
came with his mi1·acles,——Jannes and Mambres, who were
the chief of Pharaoh's magicians, said unto him, This is our
business, and we can do thus with our euchantments3 you
therefore are like one bringing straw into Ephraim, which is
the city of broad-corn, and out of which is provision for many
places: therefore, how (loth any carry in straw thium-V &c
