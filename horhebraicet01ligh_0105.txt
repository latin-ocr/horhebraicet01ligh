The country of Jericko. 95

Baaleth; behold, these are Judalz.'' (Here is a mistake of
the transcribers‚ for it should be written, of Dan, Josh. xix.
44.) “ Baalah, and Jiim, and Azen1‚-—behold, these are of
Dan'' (it should be written, of Judah, Josh. xv. 29); “ namely,
the houses were of Judah,— the fields of Dan.''

Inrn Psal. cxxxii. 63 “ We heard of it.” (the ark) “in
Ephratah” (that is, Shiloh, a city of Ephraim); “ we found
it in the fields of the wood’' 0272 Ἳὶζὶξι, that is, in Kiriath-
jearim, 1 Sam. vii. 1, 860.) ⁶

OHAP. XLVI.
The country of Jerz'cho, and tlte situation of the Oity.

HERE we will borrow ,Josephus’sn pencil, Ἵὸρυται μὲν ἐν
πεδίῳ, ψιλὸν δὲ ὑπέρκειται αὐτῆς καὶ ἄκαρπον ὅρος μήκιστον, &c.
“ J ericho is seated in a plain, yet a certain barren mountain
hangs over it, narrow, indeed, but long; for it runs out north-
ward to the country of ScythopoliS,—and southward, to the
country of Sodom, and the utmost coast of the Asphaltites.”

Of this mountain mention is made, Josh. ii. 22, where the
two spies, sent by Joshua, and received by Rallab, are said
to “ conceal themselves.⁷’

Ἀυτίκειται δὲ τούτῳ τὸ περὶ τὸυ Ἰορδάνην ὅρος, &a “ Op-
posite against this, lies a mountain on the other side Jordan,
beginning fron] J ulias on the north, and stretched southward
as far as Somorrha, which bounds the rock of Arabia. In
this is a mountain, which is called the Iron mountain, reach- ‘
ing out as far as the land of Moab. But the country which
lies between these two niountainous places, is called the Great
Plaz’n (Μέγα πεδίου), extended from the village Ginnaber to ·
the lake Asphaltites, in length a thousand two hundred fur-
longs” (a hundred and fifty miles), “ in breadth, a hundred
and twenty furlongs” (fifteen miles); and Jordan cuts it in
the 111iddle.”

Hence you may understand more plainly those things that
are related of “ the plains of Jericho‚” 2 Kings xxv, 5 ; and
what ἡ περίχωρος τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, “ the region about .Jordan‚”
means, Matt. iii. 5.
