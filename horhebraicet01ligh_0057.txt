Jerusalem did not let out their houses at a price to those that
came to the feasts, but granted them to them gratis.” Com-
pare Matt. xxvi. 17.

Nevertheless, the city was divided between the tribe of
J udah and Benjamin, and the distinguishing line went
through the very court of the Temple: “ Whati was in the
lot of J udah? The mountain of the Temple, the Chambers of
them that kept it, the Courts. And what in the lot of Ben-
Jamin3 The Porch of the Temple, and the Temple, and the
Holy of Holies. And a line went out of the lot of J udah‚
and passed on into the lot of Benjamin, and in it was the
altar built.'’ The Gloss3 “ The whole breadth of the outmost

house of David, and the sepulchre of Huldah the prophetess ς
which were there from the days of the former prophets: nor
in it do they suffer a dunghill by reason of creeping things ς
nor do they bring out of it into the streets scaffolds set up
against the walls by reason of defilementz nor in it do they
make chimneys, by reason of the smoke: nor do they nourish
cocks in it for the sake of the holy things: nor do the priests
