in the Holy Scripture‚—and they to be among the Kenites,
the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites.- Let them dream on.

“ Let m him that kills the high-priest by a sudden chance,
fly to a city of refuge; but let him never return thence.”

Compare these words with the state of the Jews, killing
Christ.

Beth-lehem.

THE Jews are very silent about this city : nor do I remember
that I have read any thing in them concerning it, besides
those things which are produced out of the Old Testament3
this only excepted, that the Jerusalem Gemaristsn do confess
that the Messias was born there before their times.

Βηθλεὲμο κώμη τίς ἐστιν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ Ἰουδαίων, ἀπέχουσα
σταδίους τριακονταπέντε Ἱεροσολύμων· “ Beth-lehem is a certain
town in the land of the J ews, thirty-five furlongs distant from
Jerusalem :” and that towards the south.

The father of the ecclesiastical annals, citing these words
of Eusebius, ἈκμήσαντοςΡ δὲ τοῦ πολέμου ἔτους ὀκτωκαιδεκά-
του τῆς ἡγεμονίας Ἀδριανοῦ κατὰ Βήθηκα πόλιν, ἅτε. thus ren-
ders them in Latin; “J amq vero, cum, decimo octavo anno
imperii Hadriani, bellum, juxta urbem Beth-lehem nuncu-
patam (quae erat rerum omnium praesidiis munitissima, neque
adeo longe a civitate Hierosolymarum sita) vehementius ac-
cenderetur,” Sec. “ But now, when in the eighteenth year
of the empire of Adrian, the war was more vehemently kin-
dled near the town called Beth-lehem (which was very well
fortified with all manner of defenee, nor was seated far from
the city of J erusalem),” &c

The interpreter of Eusebius renders Βήθηκα, Beth-thera:
not illy, however it be „not rendered according to the letter:
perhaps κ crept into the word instead of ρ, by the careless-
ness of the copiers. But by what liberty the other should render
it Beth-lehem, let himself see. Eusebius doth certainly treat
of the city 7N⁸3‚ Betar (it is vulgarly written Emer), of
the destruction of which the Jews relate very many things
