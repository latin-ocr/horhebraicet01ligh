CHAMMATH and Rakkath are joined together, J osh. xix. 35.
For they were very neighbouring cities3 Rakkath is Tibe-
rias,——and Chammath κώμη Ἀμμαοῦς, the town Ammaus, in
J osephus.

Of their neighbourhood, the Jerusalem Talmudistsn write
thus : “ The men of a great city may walk’' (on the sabbath)
“ through a whole small city'' (which was within a sabbath-
day’s journey) 3 ‘⁶ but the inhabitants of a small city wall< not
through a whole great city.'' And then follows, “ Formerlyo
the men of Tiberias walked through all Chammath 3 but the
men of Chammath passed not beyond the arch: but now
those of Chammath and those of Tiberias do make one city.''

And Ρ the Babyloniam Talmudists <1 thus, &³5:125 ῘΠῺΠΌ
³7⁸2 “ from Chammath to Tiberias is a lnile,”

“ Chammath f is Tiberias. And why is it called Cham-
math? &⁸5:20 *⁷217 D'ltD &y By reason of the Ohammi, warm
haths of Tiberias.”

It is not seldom called *³7:17 sim-1⁶ Chammath of Gadara ;'
not only because it was very near the Gadarene country,—
for the channel of Jordan only was between 3—but because it
was built, as it seems, on both the banks of Jordan, the two
parts of the town joining by a bridge.

“ RabbahS said, Chammath is the same with the warm
baths of Gadara, and Rakkath is Tiberias,’'

“ Itt was lawful for the Gadarene& R. Judah Nasi per-
mitting them, to go down into Chammath [on the sabbath]‚
and to return into Gadara: but the men of Ohammath
might not go up into Gadara.''

Behold ! Tiberias so near to Chammath, that it was almost
one city with it: and Ghannnath so near to the country of
Gadara, that thence it took the name of ⁶ Chammath of Ga-
dara?
