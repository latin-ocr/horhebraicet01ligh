south part of Jerusalem, and mount Sion is to be reckoned
within the lot of Judah,—how could this be, when Jeru-
salem, which was of the lot of Benjamin, lay between J udea
and Sion ἓ

I answer, 1. No necessity compels us to circumscribe Sion
precisely within the portion of J udah 3 when David conquered
it, not as he was sprung of J udah, but as he was the king of ·
the whole nation.

2. But let it be allowed, that Sion is to be ascribed to
Judal1,——that dividing line, between the portion of Judah
and Benjamin, concerning which we made mention before,
went not from the east to the west 3 for so, indeed, it had
separated all Jerusalem from all Sion: but it went from south
to north, and so it cut Jerusalem in two, and Sion in two:
so that bot-h were in both tribes,-—and so also was mount
Moriah.

II. It is objected, that, at this day, a hill and ruins are
shown to travellers under the name of Sion, and the tower of
David, on the south part of the city.

I answer, But let us have leave not to esteem all things
for eracles, which they say, who now show those places3
since it is plain enough that they mistake in many other
things: and let it be without all controversy, that they study
not so much truth in that affair, as their own gain. I wish
less credit had been given to them, ancl more search had been
made out of Scripture, and other writers, concerning the
situation of the places

GHAP. XXIV.
Some builclz‘nys iu Aera. Bezetha. Mello.

Meum* Sion did not thrust itsclf so far eastward as mount
Aera: and hence it is, that mount Mox-iah is said, by J osc-
phus, to be “situate over-against Acra,'' rather than over-
against the Upper city : sor, ‹lescribing Aera thus, which we
produced before, ‘'A-sepos‘ δὲ [λόφος] ὁ καλούμενος Ἄκρα, &c.‚
“ There is another hill, called Aera, which bears the Lowcr
City upon it, steep ou both sides :'' in the next words he sub-
joins this», τούτου δὲ ἀντικρὺ τρίτος ἦν λόφος, “ Ovor-against this
was a third hill,” speaking of Moriah.
