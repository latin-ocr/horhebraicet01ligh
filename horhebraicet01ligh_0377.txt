SEc‘r. NJK—The δβοῑιηῑόιῖφι qf Etam. Tlee water-flate.

Tun collector of the Hebrew Gippi, Grave-stone& hath
this passage concerning the fountain of Etam: ΓΞ '‘D-52
‘'U'l tw? ΓΡ &twa-¹³¹> ἶἾἾΞίἻ “ ln the way betwixt Hebron
and Jerusalem, is the fountain Etam, from whence the waters
are conveyed by pipes into the great pool at J e1·usalem.” It
is so translated by the learned Hottinger, who also himself
adds, ‘⁶ I suppose here is meant the Probatica, or the pool by
the Sheep-gate.”

The Rabbins often and again tell us of an aqueduct from
the fountain of Etam to Jerusalem. But it may very well be
doubted whether that fountain be in the way to Hebron;
or whether those waters ran into the pool by the Sheep-gate.
For,

I. lf the fountain of Etam be the same with the waters
of Nephtoah, mentioned Josh. xv. 9 3 which the Gloss sup-
posethf (where it is treating about the fountain of Etam),
then it lieth quite in another quarter from Hebron 3 for He-
bron lies on the south, ancl Nephtoah on the west.

II. The waters streaming from the fountainEtam were
not conveyed into the city, but into the Temple: which
might be abundantly made out from the Talmudists‚ if there
were any need for it. And gprobably Aristeas hath respect
to this aqueduct: ’Ὕδατος δὲ ἇνέκλειπτός ἐστι σύστασις, ὥσ.
“ There is a confluence of water that never fails [speaking of
the Temple]; as2if there were a great spring within naturally
flowing: and for the space of five furlongs (as appeared every-
where about the Temple), there were certain recept-acles
made, under the earth, by a wondrous and unspealfable
art.’' Andg a little after: “ They led nie out of the city
above four furlongs, where one bade me lean down my head
at a certain place, and listen to the noise that the flow 'of
waters there 111ade,” &c

In a word, to any onc that is conversant in the T almudic
authors, nothing can be- moro plain than that the aqueduet
from tho fountain of Etam was into the Templo, and not into
