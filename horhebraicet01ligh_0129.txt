Caesarea. Strato's Tower. 119

passed a city with a very fair wall twenty furlongs, and
brought six thousand inhabitants into ith :'’ (do you think
all these were Samaritans ἓ) “ and on these he bestowed a
very fertile land3 and, in the middle of this work, he set up
a very great temple to Oaesar, and made a grove about it of
three half furlongs, and called the city Sebaste.''

“ The Samaritans (saith R. Benjamini) have not the letters
Π (He), or 37 (Ain), or Π (Cheth). Π (He) is in the name of
Abraham, ἿἾΠ Cri& ΓΝἸ And they have not honour. Π,
Oheth, is in the name of Isaac, ἻΞΠ ΞΠίἹ ΓΝἹ And they have
not morey. 37 (Ain) is in the name of Jacob, Cla-5³7 ΓΝἹ
rmy And they have not yentleness. But for these letters they
use Ν (Aleph): and hence it is known that they are not of the
seed of Israel.” Compare these things with the Samaritan
interpreter of the Pentateuch, and judge.

Caesarea. Πύργος Στράτωνος. Strato's Tower.

THE Arabian interpreter thinks the first name of this city
was Hazor, J osh. xi. 1. The Jews, Ekron, Zeph. ii. 4. “ R.
Abhu sait.l1k,” (he was of Oaesarea,) ἾΡΞΤΠἾ ῙἾἻῙᾏᾈῩ “ Ekron
shall be rooted out ;'' this is Caesarea, the daughter of Edom‚
which is situated among things profane. She was a goad,
sticking in Israel, in the days of the Grecians. But when
the kingdom of the Asmonean family prevailed, it overcame
her, &c. R. J osi Bar Chaninah saith, What is that that is
written, ‘And Ekron shall be as a Jeb11site3' (Zech. ix. 7.)
These are the theatres and judgment-seats which are in
Ed0m‚ in which the chief men of J udah hereaftcr shall pub-
licly teach the law. R. Isaac said, Leshem is Panias, and
Ekron is Caesarea, the daughter of Edom.''

The Jews are scarcc in earnest when they say Oaesarea is
the same with Ekron: but partly, they play with the sound
of the words {ww-237 ‘ Ek1·on‚' and ἾῇἒῖΠ ‘ shall be rooted out ‹3'
partly, they propound to themselves to reproach her, whilo
they compare that city, for the most part heathen, with
Ekron, the city of Beelzebub.
