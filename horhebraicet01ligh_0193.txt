The consistories qs note. 183

ἶῖἾΠ ἾἹἾΞ Beror Ohel, seems to design a place: but what
place? Indeed, the Sanhedrim of R. Jochanan was in Jabneh;
but his consistory‚ ὋἾἾ ΠἮ his seat ‹2fy·ucl91nent‚ seems to
be distinguished from the Sanhedrim. So Paul was brought
up at the feet of Rabban Gamaliel3 not in his Sanhedrim,
but '¹3³7 ΠἮΞ, in lais consistory or school. So you may
conjecture, that Rabban J ochanan, besides that he sat presi-
dent of the chief Sanhedrim, had his peculial· consistory 111
J abneh itself, or in some neighbour place.

That which follows, ‘⁶ A tradition, the sound of 1111115,”
810. 15 cleared by the Glossers: “ The sound of mills in
Burni was a sign that there was a circumcision there; as if
it had been publicly proclaimed, The infant' 5 week expires 111
11115 place. And the sound of a mill was a sign that spices
were ground to be applied to the wound of the circumcision.
It was a time of persecution, wherein it was forbidden to
circumcise: they feared‚ therefore, by any public notice to
make known that there was to be a circumcision3 but they
appointed this sign.”

‘ A candle in Beror Chel.'—The Gloss writes, ‘⁶ The light
of one candle in the day-time, but many candles burning in
the night, gave a sign, as if one had given notice by a public
proclamation that a feast of circumcision was there,” 810.

Another Gloss is thus: “ They were wont to light candles
at a circumcision. It was also a custom to spread a table-
cloth at the door: hence is that, A custom prevailed at J eru-
salem, that as long as the tablecloth was spread at the door,
travellers went in.”

The Aruch writes thus 3 “Inr the time of persecution
they could not celebrate public matrimony, nor public cir-
cumcision3 therefore, they did them secretly: wheresoever,
therefore, were lighted candles on the lintel of the door, they
knew that there was a wedding-feast there 3 and wheresoever
was the sound of mills, there was a circmncision.’'
