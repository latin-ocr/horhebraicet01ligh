31 2 Ch oroqraplciccel Notes.

The Persian interpreter, instead of Nam, hath DLJZNJ
Nubelis, that is, Neapolis, which is also Sychem: but for
what reason, I know not. Nor do l suppose that it was con-
ceived by any one expositor, that the widow’s son, whom
Christ raised from death, was a Samaritan 3 he was indeed
upon the borders of Samaria, but a great distance from
Sychar.

S Ec'r. II.—Coowerminy tlae lVaz'n ον Naim in ,Iosephus
and the Rabbms.

THE Darshanim [προθέων-3] upon Bereshith Rabba m speak
of a certain place called ΠΨ) Naim, upon this occasion:
“ Issachar is a bony [or strong] ass, Gen. xlix. 14· It is
spoken of lssachar⁹s country, for as an ass is low before and
behind, and high in the middle, so is it in the tribe of
Issachar; it is a valley here and a valley there, and hilly
otherwhere3 it couches between two borders. These are the
two valleys, 3500 nyp: the valley of Pislan, and the valley
of Jezreel. And he saw that rest was good, Dylfl *u this is
Tinaam: and the land that it was pleasant, ΠΨ] w this is
Naim.''

We have here, by the way, a taste of those allegorical and
far-fetched ways of expounding the Scriptures, wherein these
egregious commentators do so much please and value them-
selves. However, we are thus far beholding to them, that
they have given us to understand that there was a Nain in
the tribe of Issachar, called so from the pleasantness of its
situation (as indeed Dyln Tinaam bears the same derivation),
which we have some reason to judge was the same Nain with
ours in the evangelist, and that in Josephus.

“ It ¹¹ was usual for the Galileans, coming up to the holy
city to the feasts, to take their journey through the Samari-
‘cans’ country, καὶ τότε mo* ὁδὸν αὐτοῖς κώμης τῆς Νᾶὶς λεγομένης’
“And then their way lay through a town called Nais.'' I
confess the Greek expressions arc something perplexed3 but
it is no great matter. ‘⁴ It happened that some of the Sama-
ritans and inhabitants of the great plain fought with them,
and killed a great number.'’

You may think he repeats tho very sanic story, though
