Israel. It obtained this honour, by reason of the university
translated thither by Rabbi Judah, and there continued for
many ages. It was ennobled by thirteen ‘¹ synagogues: among
which ΓἎἎἾἾΕἻ ΝΓᾪἾΓΨ &riwin “thee ancient Serongian
synagogue was one.” It was famous also for the Sanhedrim
sitting there; for the Tahnudic Misna, perhaps, collected here
by R. J udah3 and for the Jerusalem Talnmdf, written there
for certain. That very volume does openly speak the place
where it was published: in which the words ΝΞΠ here, and
&27³7 kitker, do most plainly design Tiberias, almost in infi-
nite places. But there is a greater controversy about the time ε
it is agreed upon, by very many learned men, that this Tal-
mud was written about the year of Christ 230: which I do
indeed wonder at, when t e mention of the emperor Diocle-
tian‚ unless I am very much mistaken, does occur in it. Let
us note the places :—

Docletinus came hither [to Tiberias]‚ they saw R. Chaija Bar
Abba climbing a sepulchre to see him.” This story is repeated
in Nazirh‚ and he is there called Dirlva Doclz'mcs, by an
error, as it seems, of the copiers.

³:³1 isirin man] rna-1 araba-r “ Dioletinus gathered
the rivers together, and made the sea of Apamia.'' And
this story is recited in Ohetubothk‚ and there he is called
