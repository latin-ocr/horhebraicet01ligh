begins Phoenice.” The sum is two hundred and fifty-four
miles. He had named J oppa before, ‘J oppa of the Phoe-
nicians.’ But now, supposing he makes Joppa the border
of Palestine‚ and the beginning of Phoenice, there are from
Pelusium to Joppa, himself reckoning, almost a hundred miles
more than in Strabo. Nor is there any thing to answer from
the difference of the measure of Strabo's furlongs, and Pliny's
miles. For they go by the same measure, themselves being
witnesses: for to Strabo, τὸ μίλιον ὀκτοστάὸιου, “ Eightu
furlongs make a mile ;'' and, to Pliny, “ Α0 furlong makes a
hundred and twenty-five of our paces 2²⁵—which comes to the
same thing.

We must therefore say, that by the ‘ end of Palestine, ' in
Plinyo, is properly signified the end of it, touching upon
Phoenicia properly so called3—that is, upon the borders of
Tyre and Sidon. For when he calls J oppa, “ J oppa of the
Phoenicians,''—he does not conclude J oppa within Phoenicia ;
but because the sea, washing upon that shore of Palestine‚
was divided in common speech into the Phoenician and the
Egyptian sea (so Strabo before, ‘⁶ Afterward J oppe; after
that, the shore of Egypt,” &c.) ς and because the Phoenicians
were famous for navigation2—he ascribed their name to
J oppa, a very eminent haven of that shore. But he stretched
the borders of Palestine a great way farther 3—namely‚ so far
till they meet with the borders of Tyre and Sidon. So far,
therefore, doth Pliny’s measure extend itself 3 to wia—that,
from Idunma, and the rising of the Sirbon lake, to the borders
of Tyre and Sidon, there be one hundred and eighty-nine
miles, The place that divided these meeting-bounds to the
Jews, was Acon, or Ptolemais3 which we shall note, when
we come thither :—but whether it was so to Pliny, remains
obscure. But it is a more probable opinion, that he eomputcd
according to the vulgar and most known distinction.

Gulielmus Tyriusl‘, measuring the borders of the Tyre of his
time southward, extends them to four or five miles: “ For it
is extended southward towards Ptolomais, as far as to that
place, which, at this day, is called ‘ tho district of Soanda-
rion,' which is four or five miles.” lif, therefore, it should be
