Lasha, southward, Zeboim3 after it, Admah; after it, Go-

III. The Asphaltites, saith Josephusm, is extended in
length, Μέχρι Ζοάρων τῆς Ἀραβίας, “ unto Zoar of Arabia ;’'
and, Deut. xxxiv. 3, Moses, from mount Nebo, beheld Zoar
from the utmost bounds of the land on that side, as he had
beheld the utmost bounds of it from other sides.

IV. En-gedi is Hazezon-tamar, so the Targum of Onkelos

Josephusq indeed saith, that this oastle was οὐ πόρρω
