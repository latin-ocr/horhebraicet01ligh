Hebron. 103

O H A P. XLIX.
Hebron.

FROM Jericho we proceed to Hebron, far off in situation,
but next to it in dignity: yea, there was a time, when it
went before Jerusalem itself in name and honour ;—namely,
while -the first foundations of the kingdom of David were
laid3 and, at· that time, Jericho was buried in rubbish, and
Jerusalem was trampled upon by the profane feet of the
Jebusites.

Hebron was placed, as in the mountainous country of
Judea‚ so in a place very rocky, but yet in a very fruitful
coast.

'm 1:³³1me *1⁸17 ΓΝ “ There2 is no place, in all the land of
Israel, more stony than Hebron : thence, a burying-place of
the dead is there.'' The Gemarists sift what that means:
“ Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt, Num.
xiii. 22.” And they reduce it to this sense, which you may
find cited also in R. Solomon, upon that text of Moses,
“There is no land more excellent than Egypt; as it is said,
‘ As the garden of the Lord, as Egypt? nor is there in Egypt
any place more excellent than Zoan; as it is said, ‘ Her
princes were in Zoan 3' and yet Hebron was seven times
nobler‚ however it were rocky, than Zoan.'' For this tradiss
tion obtaineda among them, pum-m Dum: :mmmm ³³7³&
“ R-ams from Moab, lambs from Hebron.” And to this they
apply that of Absalom, “ Let me go, I pray, to Hebron,
that I may pay my vow.—And why to Hebron ff—R. Bar Bar
Chanan saith, He went thither, that thence he might fetch
lambs for sacrifice. {mm &⁸375 &3537 mm& NID'LDD'J
ΝΣἾἾΞΡ For the turf was fine, yielding grass acceptable to
sheep‚” &c.

You may observo the situation of Hebron, in respect of
Jerusalem, from those things which are related of a daily
custom and rite in the Temple. “Theb president of the
service in the Temple was wont to say every morning, Go,
and see whether it be time to kill the sacrifice. If it were
time, he, that was sent to see, said, ἾΝρἾΞ It is light. Mathia
