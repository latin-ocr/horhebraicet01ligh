SECT. L—Dajfferent readiuys, Βηθανία and Βηθαμαρά.

IT is observed by all that treat upon this evangelist, that
the reading (loth vary in some copies3 and 'this instance is
alleged for one :

Tafirab ἐν Βηθαβαρᾷ ἐγένετο· εἰ) ἄλλοις δὲ ἆυτιγράφοις, ἐν
Βηθανίᾳ· “These things were done in Bethabara ,· but in other
copies it. is in Beffiany3'

But Drusius; “The Vulgar Greek copies have it in
Bethabara, which Epiphanius, in the place above mentioned,
calls Betlcamara. Ταῦτα εἰ) Βηθαμαρᾷ ἐγέυετο· ἐν ἄλλοις
δὲ ἀντιγράφοις, εἰ) Βηθανίᾳ. Of this reading petavius is
silent.''

It might easily happen that Bethabara should change
int-0 Bethamarm partly, considering “the affinity of the
characters, which, saith he, tanta est in antiqua Scriptura,
ut vix discerni possit μῦ ἐι βῆτα, et contra‚” “is so great in
ancient writings‚ that μῦ and βῆτα can hardly be distin-
guished ;” partly, that the alternate use of 73 (Mem) and Ξ,
(Beth) is so very common in those countrieS.
