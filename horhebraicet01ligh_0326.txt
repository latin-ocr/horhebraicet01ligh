the event of that war, gave this town the name of Nicopolis.
Before the city near the road (where our Saviour, after he
had arisen from the dead, walking with Cleophas, made as if
he was hastening to another town), there is a certain medi-
cina] spring, wherein not only men that are sick‚ being
washed, are cured, but other sort of animals also, of whatso-
ever diseases they are afflicted with. The report is, that
Christ, -as he was once going that way with his disciples‚
turned aside to that fountainj and having washed his feet in
it, the waters have ever since retained a healing quality and
virtue in them.''

We leave the credit of the story to the relater of it z only
one thing we may observe from the hint he gives us, that it
is no wonder if, in the evangelist's time, Emmaus was but a ’

ancient name Emmaus should change into Nicopolis, when
the place itself became a Roman colonyY.

From Emmaus to Lydda it is σΙιαφηραίῃης and from Lydda to
the sea is valley.''
If you would hear Ptolemy more largely, thus he writes z
Jamnia . 65. 40. 32. 0.
Lydda . . 66. 0. 32. 0.
Antipatris 66. 20. 32. 0.
Emmaus ’ἀ 65. 45. 31- 45.
Jerusalem 66. 0. 31. 40.
