town of our shore, DC miles: from the Persian bay, CXXII
miles. Two double ways meet here3 the way of those who
went to Palmyra of Syria3 and of those who came from
Gaza.‘'' These words, “it is distant from Gaza,” &c. are
they with which we have to do.

What! sia: hundred miles from Gaza to Petra, the metro-
polis ol' the Moabites? I wonder the very learned Heidmanb
should so softly swallow down these words, and that without
any regret. But let me have leave to conjecture that Pliny,
in his own copy, wrote thus, ‘⁶ It is distant from Gaza, a town
of our shore, GXM :³² but by the carelessness of the tran-
scriberS, the numerical letter X was cut into two parts, after
this manner, )(‚ and the left half of it⁷ at length, closed in
with the former C, in this manner (), and so at last passed
into D; and the other right-hand half remained thus, G, and
was reokoned for a hundred.

However we may mistake in our conjecture, yet certainly
concerning the space and number of the miles, we (lo not so
mistake. For allow thirty-eight miles, or thereaboutS, be-
tween Petra and Asphaltites, and grant twenty miles, or
thereabouts, to the breadth of that sea (that we may go
something in the middle between Pliny and ‚Iosephus con-
eerning the breadth of it), then there will remain of the
hundred and ten miles which we suppose Pliny wrote, fifty-
two miles, or thereabout, from that sea to Gaza: which is
not far from the mark. But the mark is vastly overshot,
when six hundred miles are assigned from Gaza to Petra.
You will surely favour our computation, and conjecture of
the injury done Pliny by the transcribers, when you shall
have observed‚ that the first shore of Gaza is, according to
Ptolemy, as we have said, in degr. 65. 263 and Petra is only
in degr. 66. 45.

Let us, therefore, grant fifty-two or fifty-three miles, or
thereabouts, for the breadt-li of the land from the shore os the
Mediterranean sea to the Asphaltites: you must allow some
more miles between the Mediterranean shore and Jordan:
because by how much the more broad the Asphaltites is, so
much the loss broad is the land3 and the same must be said
of the sea of Gennesaret- and Sainoclionitis. And Galilee is
