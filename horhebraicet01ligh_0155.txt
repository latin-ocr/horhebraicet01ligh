On the south, the land of Zebulon was bounded by that of
Issachar, extending itself in breadth μέχρι Γευυησαρίτιδος, “ 10
(310111108111019Ἰ touching only upon Gennesaret, 1101 compre-
hending Gennesaret- within it. So the same J osephus speaks
in the place alleged, that Νεφθαλίται παρέλαβον τὰ πρὸς τὰς
ἀνατολὰς τετραμμένα μέχρι Δαμασκοῦ πόλεως, ((1110 men of
Naphtali took those parts that ran 0111 eastwardly unte the
city of Damascus.” It would be ridiculous, if you should so
render μέχρι Δαμασκοῦ πόλεως, (( 111110 1110 city of Damascus,”
as to include Damascus within the land of Naphtali. The maps
are guilty of the like 8010018111, while they make Zebulon, which
only came μέχρι Γευνησαρίτιδος, (( 111110 1110 lake of Gennesaret‚⁷'

Α111101101111118, 10 say nothing of others, and compare these
words of J osephus with him.

Hither perhaps 18 that 10 be reduced, which hath 1101 a
little vexed interpreters in J osh. xix3 where Jordan is twice
mentioned, in defining 1110 11111118 of the tribe of Naphtali3

dan? and, ver 34, ΨὮΨΠ Πῆτη ΠᾎῙΠ ΠἾῚΠἿΞη( ‘The
going 0111 from thence [that 18,1“1·0111 the 8011111 bordei] was 10

What hath the land of Naphtali to do with Jordan in
J udah ἕ

Ι answer, J udah, that is, J udea, is here opposed 10 Galilee:
J udah is 1101 here spoken of as opposed 10 1110 other tribes.
Before ever the name of Samaria was risen, the name of
Galilee was very well known, J osh. xx. 7; aud 80 was the
name of J udea: and at that time one might not improperly
divide the whole land within Jordan into Galilee and J udea:
when as yet there was no such thing as the name of Samaria.
The words alleged, therefore, come 10 11118 801180, as if it had
been said, ‘The north bounds of Naphtali went out east-
wardly to Jordan in Galilee: in like manner the south bounds
went out eastwardly to Jordan now running 11110 J udea ;’ that
is, the country without Galilee‚ which as yet was not called
Samaria, but rather J udea.

The bounds, certainly, of the land of Naphtali seem 1ο
1011011 Jordan on both sides, both on the north and the south ;
