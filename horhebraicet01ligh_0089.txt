Synayoyues and sohools. 7 9

in Pesikta: R. Menahem, from R. Hoshaia‚ saith, Four hun-
dred and eighty synagogues were in Jerusalem, according to
the arithmetical value of the word *fibt‘vmff' Note, that the
letter Ν is not computed. [0:40· ³7:30. ΠΞ400. ³:10]

ΒἾἿἾἼΣΒΞζῬΝ ‘sz nm: “ The synagogue of the Alexan-

drians‚'' is mentioned by the Tahnudists: concerning which
also the Holy Scripture speaks, Acts vi. 9.

“Eleazart Ben R. Zadok received (for a price) the syna-
gogue of the Alexandrians, and did his necessary works in it.
The Alexandrians had built it at their own charge?7 This
story is recited by the Babylonian Talmudists, and they for
Alexandrians have ΞἯΟἾἿὮ The Braziers. For so theyu
write: “ Τ116Χ synagogue of the Braziers, which was at
Jerusalem, they themselves sold to R. Eleazar‚” Sco. The
Gloss renders ΕἾἿΟἾἾὯ by ΠΨἾΠΞ ἛἾἾΒ ‘ workmen in brass.'
-The reason why the Alexandrians were so called, you may
fetch, perhaps, from this story : “ There y was a brass cymbal
in the Temple3 and there being a crack in it, the wise men
brought artifieers from Alexandria to mend it, &c. There
was also a brass mortar in the Temple, in which they beat
their spices; and there being a crack in it, the wise men
brought artificers in brass from Alexandria to mend it‚'' &c.

consider well, what *Dsslm ἶἾῖῃί) “ The language of Tursi,''
means in that legend. “ BigthanZ and Teresh &³0th ”lm
ἸἾΠ (perhaps) were two Tarsians :'’ or, if you will, ‘ two arti-
ficers :² “and they talked together *mim pub] in the lan-
guage of Tursi'' (where the Gloss, ‘Tursi is the name of a
place'); “ and they knew not that Mordecai was one of the st
elders in the chamber Gazith, and that he understood seventy
languages,” &e.

Ina the place noted in the margin, these words are related
concerning the sending away the goat Azazel, or the scape-
goat: “ The chief priests permitted not an Israelite to lead
away the scape-goat into the wilderness: but once, one Ar-
sela, who was an Israelite‚ led him away : and they made him
a footstool because of the Babylonians‚ who used to pull off
his hair, and to say, Take it, and go.'’ The Gemara thus3
