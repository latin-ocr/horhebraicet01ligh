nether new city'' (the Upper was the hill Bezetha, the Nether
was a place somewhat lower on the east of Sion), “ and
thence along Kedron to mount Olivet. Thence bending to
the south, he shut up the mountain round, to the rock called
περιστερεῶνος, the Dove-cote,—and the hill beyond, which lies
over the valley of Siloam. From thence bending on the
west, he came even into the vale of the fountain. After
which, ascending along the sepulchre of Anan the chief
priest, and enclosing the mountain where Pompey pitched
his tents, he bended to the north side, and going forward as
far as the village, which is called, ‘ tlae house, or place of tur-
pentine' '' (perhaps 175& ΠἮ); “ and after that, taking in
the sepulchre of Herod, he came eastwardly to his own
intrenclnnent.'' ’
