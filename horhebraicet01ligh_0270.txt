it Orabz'mos [543299] To which sense our R. Judah, who

thinks that they were not rancus, but the inhabitants of the
city of Orbo, that ministered to Elias. But here the objection
of Kimchi holds : ‘⁶ Grod commanded Elias (saith he), that he
should hide himself, that. none should know thath he was there.
And we see that Ahab sought him every where,” &a

But omitting the triflingness of the dream, we are search-
ing after the chorographical concern: and if there be any
truth in the words of R. Judah, that there was a city 5:527
Orba by name near Beth-shean‚ we find the situation of the
brook Gherith‚——or, at least, where he thought it ran. 'Phat
brook had for ever laid hid in obscurity, had not Elias lay
hid near it; but the place of it as yet lies hid. There are
some maps which fix it beyond Jordan, and there are others
fix it on this side3 some in one place, and some in another,
uncertainly, without any settled place. But Ι especially
wonder at Josephus, who saith, that ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς τὰ πρὸς
νότον μέρη, ποιούμενος παρὰ χειμάρρῳ τινὶ τὴν διατριβήν· “ heC
went away towards the north, and dwelt near a certain
brook;” when God in plain words saith, And thou skalt
turn thee, or φο towards the east, ΠᾩἾΕ ζῐῖῗ ῙᾏἾᾷςῆε for he
was now in Samaria. God adds, “Hide thee at the brook
Gherith‚ ΠἿΞΓΓᾛΞ 173] Ἶὶζθζζζ which is before Jorclan.” So,
you will say, was every brock that flowed into Jordan. But
the senso of those words, “ which is before Jordan,'’ is this,
“ which (brook), as thou goest to Jordan, is flowing into it
on this side .Jordan.’' So that although the Rabbin mis-
takes conccrning tho creatures that fed Elias, yet perhaps
he <locs not so mistake concerning thc placo where the brook
was.

The story of the Syrophoenician woman, bescoching our
Saviour for her possessed daughter, and of his return thence
by Decapolis to tho sca of Galilec, hath occasioned a dis-
course of ·’ the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, and the region os
I)ccapolis.' And now, having finishcd the search aster the
places, let us spcak one word of the woman herself. She is
