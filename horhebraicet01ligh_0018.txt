“The land of Samaria is reckoned clean, and the gathering
together of its waters clean, and its dwellings clean, and its
paths clean :” which the J ewish curiosity would by no means
pronounce of a heathen land. But as to many other things,
they made no differenee between them and the Gentiles.

The J ewish doctors do, indeed, particularly apply that
division of the three countries in the place alleged, to the
tradition and canon coneerning ³³:7⁸2 ; but yet they do every

not to eat of them, as they did before.
