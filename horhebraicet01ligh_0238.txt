kings of Graecia erected an idol: as it is said in the book
Avodah Zarah, In the corner looking north-east the Asmo-
neans hid the stenes of the altar, which the Greeks had pro-
faned with their idols.''

But whether these our interpreters suppose Gacl Jaca'n to
be that chamber where those stenes lay hid, laid up there
by the Asmoneans when they repaired the altar, concerning
which place see if you please the place in the margin03 01·
whether they suppose it to be the place itself where the idol
stood, inquire. But how much space it was thence, and What
way they went from thence to Siloam, I heartily wish they
had told us. They say only thus much of that matter, that
“it was so much space as one might wall< while a man twice
bathed, and twice dried himself.'’

Being now in the Temple we cannot but take notice of

particular part of the Temple, they that lived after had that
