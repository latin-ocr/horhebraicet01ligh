εἷς τὴν Μασθηρῶν ἀνέβη στέυην· “ He (David), with those that
were with him, went up to the strait place of Masthei·i.”

SEcT. IV. The wilderness of Juclea, where John
Baptfist was.

Tuos far we have launched out into the wilderness of J u-
dah, or Idumea ς and that the more wissingly, because in de-
scribing it, Ι have described also some part of New Idumea‚
of which discourse was had in the chapter aforegoing. Now
we seek ἔρημος Ἰουδαίας, “ the wilderness of Judea‚'’ concern-
ing which the Gospels speak in the history of the Baptist.

Ι. And first, we cannot pass it over without observatiom
that it was not only without prophetical prediction that he
first appeared preaching in the wilderness, Isa. xl. 3, but
it was not without a mystery also. For when the heathen
world is very frequently in the prophets called ‘ the wilder-
ness,' and God promiseth that he would do glorious things
to that wilderness, that he would produce there pools of
waters‚ that he would bring in there all manner of fruit-
sulness, and that he would turn the horrid desert into the
pleasure of a paradise (all which were to be performed in a
spiritual sense by the gospel); it excellently suited even in
the letter with these promises, that the gospel should take
its beginning in the wilderness.

ΙΙ. Ι, indeed, think the Baptist was born in Hebron, a
city of Aaron, in the hill-country of Judea‚ Josh. xxi. 11,
Luke i. 5, 393 he being an Aaronite by father and mother.
The house of his cradle is shown to travellers elsewhere;
concerning which, inquire whether Beth Zachariah, men-
tioned in Josepl111SX‚ and the Book of the Maccabees Y,
afforded not a foundation to that tradition. lt was distant
from Bethsura only seventy furlongs, or thereabouts, as may
be gathered from the same Josephus (by which word the
Seventy renderZ South Beth-el in 1 Sam. xxx. 27); and
whether the situation does not agree, let them inquire who
please.

A little cell of his is also shewed further in the wildemess,
as it is called, of Judea, cut out ofa rock, together with his
