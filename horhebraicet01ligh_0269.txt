The city Orbo. 2:39

Szcvr. VLz-Coesarea Philippi.

Tuis city also is of the same rank with Beth-shean in the
Talmudists: and Ptolemy besides encourages us to number
it among the cities of Decapolis, who reckons it among the
cities of Midland Phoenicia3 and J osephus‚ who, in his own
Life, intimates Syrians to be its inhabitants. We correct here
that which elsewhere slipped us, namely‚ that the Arabic
interpreter, while he renders Caesarea for Hazor, J osh. xi. J,
may be understood of ‘ Caesarea of StratQ' when he seems
rather to respect this Caesarea.

And now, from what has been said, think with yourself,
reader, what is to be resolved concerning those words of
St. Mal-k, “ Jesus went from the coasts of 'Pyre and Sidon
unto the sea of Galilee, through the niidst of the coasts of
Decapolis :³³ think, I say, and judge, whether by the ‘ coasts
of 'syre and Sidon,' any place can be understood at the very
gates of Sidon; and not rather some place not very remote
from Oaesarea Philippi. And judge again, whether Deca-
polis ought to be placed within Galilee, and not rather (with
Pliny and Josephus) that a great part of it at least ought
not to be placed in the country beyond Jordan3 and if any
part of it stood in Galilee, whether it ought not to be placed
in the utmost northern coast of it, except only Scythopolis,
or Beth—shean.

BY occasion of the mention of Beth-shean, I cannot but

subjoin the mention os the city “2³3‘' from the words of R.
Judah‚ in the place at the margin :-“ R. Judah saith ἃ,

flesh, inorning and evening‚ to Elias. [1 Kings xvii. 6.] ἾὛῺ
'in-¹37 rmum {Nm 11³2 Dis-m: ΝἾΠ Τιἰαί city was in the bor-
ders ofBetlz-slcean, and was called Orbo.”

Some Jews raise a scruple whether ravens brought Elias
broad and flesh, or men called 2⁸2?wa Bavares. So Kim-

chi upon the place: “ There are some, who, by 2⁸215y
understand merchants, according to that which is said, ᾞἿἾῚ
