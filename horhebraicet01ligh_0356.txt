Why (¹, therefore, did those interpreters take the word in
two, when it was plain and etymological enough of itself3

The Syriae ‚Ion brings to mind a passage of Eustathius
upon this verse of Dionysius :

‘'Hv τε καὶ Ἰονίην περιναίεται, ηὐδάξαντο.

“ Some say, saith he, that that whole sea from Gaza as
far as Egypt, is called the lonian sea, from lo.'' Καὶ·τὴν
ἐκεῖ δὲ Γάζαν Ἰόνην καλοῦσί τινες· ἔνθα βοῦς ἢν ἐν ἀγάλματι
τῆς Ἰοῦς, ἤτοι τῆς Σελήνης· “ Indeed, some call even Gaza
itself Ione, where there is a heifer in the image of Io, or the
1noon.''

Tha-t Gaza was ever called Ione, is not commonly known3
but grant it waS, and the sea, from that place even as far as
Egypt, to have been called the Ionian sea; yet should not Ι
have derived its name from ‘ Io,’ but rather from the ‘ Iones‚’
those brassy robust men, of whose coming into Egypt, and
fixing their seats there by the sea, Herodotuse gives us a
famous relation. ’

But must we' seek for ΓΡ ῙἾ] ein Jon (or javan, as some
would have it) hereabout? To seek John about Gaza, would
be to seek him out of the land of lsi-ach at least, as the
bounds of that land were at that time determined.

lp AEnon was the place where John baptized last, imme-
diately before his imprisonment, then we must look for it
either in Galilee or Perea: for in one of those places it was
where he began his acquaintance with Herod. For however
St. Luke, speaking of Herod, mentions Galilee only within
his tetrarchy, Luke iii. 1, yet J osephus tells us f, that Ἐγέ-
νετο ὑπὸ τούτῳ [Ἀντίπᾳ] ἥ τε Περαία καὶ Γαλιλαία, “ both
Perea and Galilee were under his jurisdiction.⁵' Where
then shall we begin his first acquaintance with the Baptist3
l had once inclination to have fixed it in Galiloe3 but whilst
Ι consider better that Herodiurn was in Perea, and very
near Machaerus, John's prison, that scenis the more probable.

‚Iosephus g, speaking of Herod the Grcat and his stately
buildings, hath this amongst other things: Φρούριον ἐπιτει-
χίσας τῷ πρὸς Ἀραβίαν ὄρει προσηγόρευσεν Ἠρώδιον (uls ἑαυ-
