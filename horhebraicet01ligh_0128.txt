Samaritan is as a heathenss R. Simeon Ben Gamaliel saith,
A Outhean is as an Israelite in all things. R. Lamr, The
tradition is concerning the heathend, not concerning the
Outheans, διο. But the tradition contradicts R. Lazar,'' 850.

But that deserves to be observed‚ Ttffzyffl 1³23 372 ΞἾΠὉ

with the Israelites, are not to be believed concerning the
putting away of leaven. R. Josah saith, This is to be under·
stood of them as to their houses ; but as to their courts, they
may be suspected: for so they interpret, ‘ Leaven shall not
be found in your houses 3’ not, ‘ in your courts.'-It is a, tra-
dition. Rabban Simeon Ben Gamaliel saith, In whatsoever
precept the Outheans converse, they are more accurate in it
than the Israelites. This is to be understood, saith R. Simeon,

but now, when they have neither precept nor any remain-

who said, nmina Wss'ps'iffl] n-,ssmy '‘31‘ ‘⁶ T hirteenf cities were
drowned among the Cutheans ;'' that is, mixed and con-
sounded among them. It is something difficult what that
means, ‘⁶ They were scattered in their towns‚'' whether it is
spoken of the Gutheans residing within their own towns,—0r
of the Jews residing with theim—or of them residing with
the Jews. Whatsoever that is, it is clear certainly, both
hence and elsewhere, that the Samaritans sometime did dwell
together with the J ews, being here and there sprinkled among
them, and the ‚Jews here and there among the Samaritans.
Certainly that is worthy of observing which Josephus relates
of Herod’s rebuilding Sebaste, horetofore called Samaria:
’Evg μέν γε τῇ Σαμαρείτιδι, πόλιν καλλίστῳ περιβόλῳ τειχισά-
