of the Maccabees f, Καὶ Ἰόππην ὠχύρωσε τὴν ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάσσης,
καὶ τὴν Γάζαρα τὴν ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων Ἀζώτου· “ And he fortified
J oppe, which is on the sea, and Gazara, which is on the bor-
ders of Azotus.''

At length, according to the idiom of the Syrian dialect,
⁴5(Zain) passed into Ἴ <Daleth>3 and instead of Gazara, it was
called Gadara. Hence Strabo, after the mention of J amnia,
saith g, καὶ ἡ Γαδαρίς ἐστιν, εἶτ’ ’Ἄζωτος καὶ Ἀσκάλωνι “ and
there is &mai-is, then Azotus and Ascalon.” And a little
after; ‘¹ Philodemus the Epicurean was a Gadarene, and so
was Meleager and Menippus, ὁ σπουδογελοῖος, surnamed the
‘ ridiculous student‚’ and Theodorus the 1¹l1etorician‚” διο.

But the other Gadara, which we seek, was in Perea, and
was the metropolis of Perea. Ἐλθόντων ἐπὶ τὰ Γάδαρα, Μη-
τρόπολιν τῆς Περαίας καρτεράν· “ Being come into the parts
of Gadara, the strong metropolis of Perea.” They are the
words of J osephus ¹³.

It was sixty furlongs distant from Tiberias ῑ, by the mea-
sure of the same author.

‘⁵ Gadarak‚ the river Hieramax [ἾἾὮἾὛ Jarmoc, of which
before] flowing by it, and now called Hippodion.'' Some
reckon it among the cities of the country of Decapolis.

Anotherl city, also ‘ Gergesa' by name, was so near to it,
that that Which in Mark is called χώρα Γαδαρηνῶν, ‘the
country of the Gada1·enes‚' chap. v. 1,—in Matthew is χώρα
Γεργεσηνῶν, ‘ the country of the Gergesenes‚' chap. viii. 28:
which whether it took its name from the Girgashites, the
posterity of Oanaan,—or from the clayish nature of the soil,
(temtum Garqislcta, signifying cZagy‚)—we leave to the more
learned to be dccided. The Chaldee certainly renders that
&fuum '¹:³37 thick dm, which is in the Hebrew Πζὶζῑζξζῐ ,7ng
tlte clay gyrozmcl, 1 Kings vii. 46. ⁸ ’

The Jerusalem writers say, that m the Girgashites‚ when
J oshua came, and proclaimesL ‘⁴ He that will go out hence,
let him go,'’——betook themselves into Africa.
