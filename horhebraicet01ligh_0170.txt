years», returned 10 their own plaee.” Consider, that thirty
years passed from this aetion of Diocletian, which if you eom-
pute even from his first year, and suppose that this story was
writ in the last year of those thirty, you eome as far as the
ninth or tenth year of Constantine.

Mention also of king Sapor oeeurs, if Ι do not fail of the
true reading. zplvm 37³7: &2³70 1111111 nnn sni “A
serpent‘, under Sapor the king, devoured eamels.” Yea, I
have I know not what suspicion, that &2³72 ΞὋἾἾῖῬἾῖῬ “ Luli-
anus the king,” of whom there is mention in that very same
place, does denote Julianus the emperor. “When Lulianus
the king (say they) earne thither, a hundred and twenty
myriads aeeompanied him.'' But enough of this.

There are some who believe 1116 holy Bible was pointed
by the wise men of Tiberias. I do 1101, wonder at the impu-
denee of the Jews, who invented the story; but I wonder at
the eredulity of Christians, who applausi it. Reeolleet, I
beseeeh you, the names of the Rabbins of Tiberias, from the

’ first situation of the universityS there, to the time that it

expired : and what-at length do you find, but a kind of men

witehed3 blind, guileful, doting; they must pardon me, if I
say magieal and monstrous? Men, how unfit, how unable,
how foolish, for the undertaking! so divine a work! Read
over the Jerusalem Talmud, and see there how R. J udah, R.
Chaninah‚ R. Judan, R. Hoshaia, R. Chaija Rubba, R. Chaija
Bar Ba, R. J oehanan, R. J onathan, and the rest of the grand
doct-ors among the Rabbins of Tiberias, behave themselves!
how eal-nestly they do nothing! how ehildishly they handle
serious matters! how mueh of sophistry, froth, poison, smoke,
nothing at all, there is in their disputes! And if you ean
believe the Bible was pointed in such a school, believe also all
that the Talmudists write. The pointing of the Bible savours
of the work of the Holy spirit, not the work of lost, bliuded,
besotted, men.

R. J udah, who first removed the university to Tiberias, sat-
also 111 Zippor for many years, and there diod: so that in
both places were very famous sehools. He composed and
