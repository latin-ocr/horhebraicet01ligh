Emmaus. Kiriath-saarim.

“ FRoM Beth-horond to Emmaus it was l1illy.”-It² was
sixty furlongs distant from Jerusalem.—’Oae<†aa<0<n'0tsf δὲ μό-
νοις, ἀπὸ τῆς στρατιᾶς διαφιεμένοις, χωρίον ἔδωκεν (Οὐεσπασιανὸς)
εἰς κατοίκησιν, ὃ καλεῖται μὲν Ἀμμαοῦς, ἀπέχει δὲ τῶν Ἱεροσολύ-
μων σταδίους ἑξήκοντα. “ To eight hundred only, dismissed
the army, (Vespasian) gave a place, called Ammaus, for them
to inhabit ε it is sixty furlongs distant from Jerusalem.''

I inquire, whether this word hath the same etymology
with Emmaus ,near Tiberias, which, from the ‘ warni baths‚’
was called ΠὮΠ Oleammath. The Jews certainly do write
this otherwise ς namely, either mimas, as the Jerusalem Tal-
mudists in the place above cited3 or, ΞἺΝῺἾῺ, as the Misna.

“ Theg family (say they) of Beth-Pegarim, and Beth Zip-
peria was ΟἾΝὉἿΏῺ out of Emmaus.”-The Gloss is this;
'‘ Emmaus was the name of a place, whose inhabitant-s were
Israelite gentlemen‚ and the priests married their daughters.''

Josephus‚ mentioning some noblemen, slainh by Simeon
the tyrant, numbers one Aristeus, who was “ ai scribe of the
couneil γένος ἐξ Ἀμμαοῦς, and by extraction frma Ammaus.''
By the same author is mentioned also ’'Avavoek ὅ ἀπ’ Ἀμ-
μαοῦς, “Ananus of Animaus,'’ one of the seditious of Jeru-
salem3 who nevertheless at last fied over to Caesar.

Kiriath-jearim was before-time called Bccale, 2 Sam. vi. 2;
or Baalatle, 1 Chron. xiii. 6. Gonoerning it, the Jerusalem
writers speak thus3 “Wel find, that they intercalated the
year in Baalath. But Baalath was sometimes assigned to
Judah, and sometimes to Dan. Eltekah, and Gibbethon, and
