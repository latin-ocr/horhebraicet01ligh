on the west3 and Jordan on the east.'' The Gloss3 “The
wise men appointed, that the second tenth of the fruits,
growing within the space of a day's journey from Jerusalem,
should be carried thither to be eaten, and should not be
redeemed: *1295 *72 &a That the streets of Jerusalem
might be crowned with fruits.” .

When you consider this distance, you may well wonder
what that means, which is almost become a proverb, ‘⁶ Theg
w ›men of Lydda knead their dough, go up to the Temple,
pray, and come back, before it be leavened.’' Not that the
distance of the places is made less; but that hence may be
shown, that no disadvantage accrued to these women, who
paid their vows and performed their religion.

I very much wonder, that the authors of the maps have
held Lod and Lydda for two towns; Lod not far from Jordan
and J erich03 Lydda not far from the Mediterranean sea. A
Jew, or one versed in Jewish affairs, will laugh at these
things; when Lod and Lydda have no difference at all
between menn—unless that that is Heb1·ew,-this, Greek.

When the Sanhedrim sat in J abneh, there fiourished emi-
nent schools in Lydda. Yea, Lydda had her schools and
her learned men, when the university was gone away into
Galilee, and J abneh lamented her loss of scholars.

There R. Akibah bore the headship of the school, removed,
as I said before, from his government by Rabban Gamaliel,
‘¹ becauseh he detained at Lydda more than forty pair of i
men travelling’' (towards J abneh) “ to give their testimony to
the Sanhedrim concerning the new moon3 and suffered them
not to go forwards.”

Gamaliol being dead, or rather re1noved,-—when R. Akibah
was head in Jabneh, R. Tarphon was rector of the school
of Lydda, whom you have sometimes disputing with R. Aki-
bah, but at last yiolding to him with this cmumondation;
“ Ile that separatos himself from you, is as if he separated
himself from his own lifc.”
