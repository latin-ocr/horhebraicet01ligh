δὲ Ἰορδάνου ἑξήκοντα, &c. “ Jericho is distant from Jerusa-
lem a hundred and fifty furlongs” (eighteen miles and three
quarters), “ and from Jordan sixty furlongs” (seven miles and
a half). “ The space from thence to Jerusalem is desert and
rocky3 but to Jordan and the Asphaltites, more plain, indeed,
but alike desert, and barren.”

This our author asserts the same distance between J ericho
and Jordan elsewhere, in these words: Οἱο δὲ, πεντήκοντα
προελθόντες στάδια, βάλλονται στρατόπεδον ἀπὸ δέκα σταδίων τῆς
Ἱεριχοῦντος· “ But the Israelites, travelling forward fifty fur-
longs from Jordan, encamped the distance of ten furlongs
from J ericho :'' that is, in Gilgal, in the east coast os J ericho,
Josh. iv. 19.

But concerning the distance between J ericho and Jeru-
salem, he does not seem to agree with his countrymen. For,
however they, according to their hyperbolical style, feign
very many things tvo be heard from Jerusalem as far as J e-
richo,—to witin the sound of the gate of the Temple, when it
was opened,—the sound of Migrephah, or the little bell, Sto.
yet there are some of them, who make it to be the distance
of ‘ten parsae.' “ Rabbatl1‹i Bar Bar Channah saith, Rabbi
J ochanan saith, ”RDWDH¹3 ἾΠἾἾὝῖῬ 'KU'W'D from Jerusalem to
Jerz'clzo were ten parsoe: and yet, from thence thither the
voice of the high-priest, in the day of expiation, pronouncing
the name ιῙεΙιουαίῑ, was heard, &a The hinges os the gates
of the Temple are heard ΠΞΌ] ἿὩἾΠῙἾ mmm: as far as the
ez'yloth bound of the sabbath ;” that is, as far as a sabbath-day’s
journey eight times numbered. The Gloss hath these words;
“ The hinges, indeed, not farther, but the gates themselves
are heard to J ericho.'' There is an hyperbole in their mea-
suring of the space, as well as in the rest.

Ἐκπυρῶται δὲ ὥρᾳ θέρους τὸ πεδίον, καὶ δι’ ὑπερβολὴν αὐχ-
μοΰ περιέχει νοσώδη τὸν ἀέρα, 850. “ And that plain burns in
the summer, and, by too much heat, renders the air unhealth-
ful: for it is all without water, except Jordan 3 the palms that
grow in whose banks are more flourishing and moro fruitful
than those that grow more remote.”
