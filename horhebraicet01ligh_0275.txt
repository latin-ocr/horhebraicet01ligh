which Aila is seated, where a Roman legion and gal-rison
is now quarteredf' And the same father elsewhere& “Aila
(saith he) is in the utmost borders of palestine, joined to
the south desert, and the Red sea, whence men sail out of
Egypt into India, and thence into Egypt. And there also is
a Roman legion called Dccima,⁷’ tlce tenth..

We dare not contradict so great an oracle; otherwise my
thoughts would run back to this our Elath: and that upon
this reason especially, because it seems somewhat hard to sub-

stitute a garrison at the Red sea “under the duke of Pales-

tine‚’' when that was so far distant from palestine, and since
there was a ‘ duke of Arabia' (in which Elath at the Red sea
was) as well as of Palestine.

You see the Fathers of the traditione measuring from
Lydda by Jerusalem to Jordan in a double diary: but here
also they leave us again at uncertainties of the breadth of
the land3 because Lydda was not upon the utmost coast
of the land on that side. Unless‚ perhaps, you might say,
that whatsoever space went between Lydda and the sea was
ΒἋἻ ΓῸἾἺῺ “ the region of the sea,” esteemed as heathen
land3 when Caphar Lodim, which was seated in that interval,
and not far from Lydda, was of no better accountu. Let us

get therefore, if we can, more certain accounts, and more
faithful direction.

SECT. lV.- Ptolemy corzsullecl and amended.

I'r would be ridiculous so much as to dream, that the
breadth of this land is every where the same: since the seas
bounding on all sides, here the Mediterranean‚ there that of
Sodom, the sea of Gennesamt, the sea of Samochonitis, and
Jordan gliding between them, cannot but make the space very
unequal by their various windings.

Take a proof of this from Ptolcmy in the Mediterranean
