the palm-trees of the mountain of iron are fit to make a small
bundle to carry in the hand in the feast of Tabernacles Υ. On
the east coast of Perea was also Σιδηροῦν ὅρος, “ an iron
mountain‚''—witness Josephus Ζ. And without doubt there
were other such-like mines, scattered here and there in other
parts os that land, though of them we have no mention.

You will not at all wonder at these underminings of the
earth, seeing they brought so much profit and gain with
them, and were so necessary to the life of man. But what
shall we say of those dens and caves in rocks and mountains,
whence no gain seemed to be digged, but rather danger arose
to the neighbouring places ostentimes? For what were these,
but lurking—places for wild beasts and robbers? There is in-
finite mention of these caves both in the Holy Scriptures and
in other writings, especially in J osephus, where ὑπόνομοι, and
σπήλαια, subter-remmus passaqes, and dens, are mentioned a
thousand times. And many of these were of a vast large-
ness, scarcely to be credited; those especially in the Tal-
mudists, which are called ⁸⁶ The dens of Zedekia11,” not a
few miles in distance.

But were those hollows the work of nature, or of the
hands and industry of man? By one example, taken out of
JosepIms, the thing may be determined. Relating the story
of a castle built by Hyrcanus in Perea, among other things
he speaks thus : Ἐκ δὲ τῆς κατ’ ἀντικρὺ τοῦ ὅρους πέτρας διατε-
μὼν αὐτῆς τὸ προέχον, σπήλαια πολλῶν σταδίων τὸ μῆκος κα-
τεσκεύασεν· “ Outa of the rock against the mountain, having
cut in two the prominent parts of it, he made <lens of many
furlongs long.” And a little after, Τὰ μέντοι στόμια τῶν
σπηλαίων, ‹isarel› ἕνα δι’ αὐτῶν εἰσιέναι, καὶ μὴ πλείους, βραχύτερα
ἤνοιξε· “ [Ie made the mouths that opened into these (lens
to be strait, that but one might go in at a time, and no
more :'’ καὶ ταῦτ’ ἐπίτηδες, ἀσφαλείας ἕνεκα, τοῦ μὴ πολιορκηθεὶς
