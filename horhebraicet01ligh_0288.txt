and being found not only empty, but conferred by lot upon
none, they usnrped it for their own.''

But what then shall we say 01 Melchizedek, whom now
all acknowledge for Shem ἓ Which is more probable, that he
intruded among the Canaanites‚ now inhabiting the land, or
that they intruded upon him? Was not that land hereditary
to him and his, rather than usurped by wrong and intrusionZ
And did not 116, by the direction 61 1116 Spirit of God, betake
himself thither, rather than either that he, wandering about
nnce1²tainly‚ lighted upon that land by chance, or, acted by a
spirit of ainbition or nsurpation, violently possessed himself
of it? For my part, 1 scarcely believe, either that the
Canaanites went thither before the confusion of tongues, or
that Shem, at ‘that time, was not there: but that 116 had long
and fully inhabited the land of C‘anacm (as it was afterward

that by the privilege of a divine grant, which had destined

Hebrew 111111011, nalnely, that it, froin that time, was called
Hebrew from Helier: and that it was called the land of the
Hebrows, before it was called the land of the Canaanites.
For I can neither think that the stock of the lIebrcws had
no name for almost three hundred years after the confusion
of tongues, until the passing 01 Abraham out of Chaldea
found a name for it, which some would have3 nor inethinks
