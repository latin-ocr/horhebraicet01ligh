When the Asmoneans had snatched away this city out of
the hand of the Grecians‚ the name of it was changed into
ww.) ῙΤἺἎὩ ΠἾἾΠΝ “ The taking of the tower Shur‚” as
the Gemarists tell us in the place alleged: or as the author
of J uchasiu‚ “The1 taking of the tower ³53 Tzzcr.·”—or as
the Jerusalem Talmudists (unless my conjecture deceives me),
''WD ‘TUDm “ the tower Sici? Whether out of these words
you can make out the name of πύργος Στράτωνος, “ the tower

It was distant 'six hundred furlongs, or thereabout, from
Jerusalem (that is, seventy-five miles), as Josephus relates

that Antigonus was slain in a certain place underground⁰‚ ἐν

the city with white stone, and adorned it with most splendid
housos: in which especially he shewed the natural greatness
