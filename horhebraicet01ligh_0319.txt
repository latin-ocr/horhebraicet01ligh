SECT. II.³—Seplmrad‚ where.

Tm: Italian interpreter sor Sepharad retains Zarphath:
for so he; ‘⁶ Et i transferiti de questo esercito de figlioli de
Israel, che sono de Chenahanei‚ in fino a Zarphath‚ et i
transferiti di Jerusalem, che sono in Zarphath‚” 820. Whe-
ther too warily or too unwarily he hath thus done, let him
look to that himself.

The Greek hath Ἐφραθᾶ, E'plzratlza, with which the Ara·
bian interpreter agrees. But the Syriae with the Targumist‚
Spain. The Vulgar‚ Bosphorus, confusedly3 besides that it
makes the preposition 1 a radical let-ter. And yet Nobilius
hath this passage: “St. Jerome tells us, the other interpreters
agreed with the Hebrew word Sepharad‚ which he rendered
Bosphorus.” If he means that all agreed in acknowledging
the word Sepharad‚ he tells us no news3 but who agreed
with his word Bosphorus?

I must confess, Sepharad is not a place so obvious as
Zarephath‚ nor can any thing be offered in it but conjecture
only: and if I might be allowed my guess, I would look for
Sepharad in Edon] rather than in Spain: and that because
Obadiah prophesies against the Edomites properly so called.
Whereas, therefore, he tells us, That the captivity of lsrael,
in Sarepta of the Phoenicians, shall possess the land of the
Canaanites‚ it is probable he means, by the captivity in Se-
pharad, those captives in Edom who shall possess the cities
of the south. The Zarphathani, or Sareptani were of the
north, the Sepharadani of the south, amongst the Ἔρεμβοιῑ),
Erembi. Οὓς εἰκὸς λέγειν τοὺς Τρογλοὸύτας ”Αραβας· “ whom
you may rightly call the Troglodyte Arabs,'’ saith Strabo ὓς
that is, probably, the Horims in mount Seir; for I suspect
Horim, by ill use, might form itself into Eremb.

Ifd we consider that the Jews do generally by Edom un-
derstand the Roman empire, and indeed all the Christian
nations in the west, we shall easily perceive why they fix
