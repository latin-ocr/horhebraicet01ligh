Cities OJ‘ the Levites. 185

with this distinction from those six which were properly so
called 3 that those six afforded refuge to every one that
dwelt in them, whether he betook himself thither for that
end or no: but the other Levitieal cities were not so. And
also, that the unwitting manslayer, flying to those six eities,
dwelt there at free eost, without paying any rent 'for his

And the schools of the prophets were little universities,
and eolleges of students. For their governor they had some
venerable prophet, inspired with the Holy Spirit, and that
partook of divine revelations. The scholars were not in-
spired indeed with the same prophetieal spirit, but received
prophecies from the mouth of their master. He revealed to
them those things that were revealed to him, of the will of
God and the state of the people, of the times and events of
