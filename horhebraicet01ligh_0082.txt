OHAP. XXXII.
Tlae Gales and Doors on the North Side.

Ι. Fins‘r, we meet with the “ gat-el and chamber Nitsots ;’'
where the priests and Levites watched. This was also called
“ the gate of a song.”'

ΙΙ. The “ chamber of them that wash’' was next to that:
and the “ chalnber of Happarva,” joining to that. In that,
they washed the inwards of the sacrifices3 in this, they salted
the skins of the sacrifices. Some ¹¹¹ believe one Parva, a
magician‚ built this chamber3 others, that that magician,
Parva, made a secret hole in the wall of this chamber, that
through that he might see what was here done by the high-
priest : “ F or Π in a covered place of this chamber there was
a bath sor the great priest, in the day of expiation.”

III. Thence was the ⁶ gate of offe1·ing‚’ or of ‘ Corban :’
this was also called ‘ the gate of the women.’ The reason
rendered of the-former name is, “that by this gate they
brought in the Most Holy sacrifices, which were slain on the
north.'' But the reason of the latter is more obscure: per-
haps before that gate the women delivered their sacrifices
into the hands of the priests.

IV. After that gate, westward‚ was the “ chamber of
salt :⁵³ where⁰ salt was laid up for the offerings.

V. Following that was the “ gate Beth Mokadh‚'’ or the
“ gate of burning :” so called from a chamber adjoining‚
where a fire continually burnt for the use of the priests.
This also was called the “ gate Gorban :⁸' for, between this
and the gate last named was the chamber, where the public
treasure of the Temple was laid up. In ⁴ Beth-Mokadh’ were
four chambers 1—1. 0³⁸³sz Πῠωῖῇ ‘ The chamber of lambs ε’
where they were kept for the use of the altar. 2. ‘ The
chamber of the show-bread.' 3. The chamber, where the
stenes of the altar were laid up by the Asmoneans, when the
kings of Greece had profaned the altar. 4. The chamber‚
whence they went down into the bath,
