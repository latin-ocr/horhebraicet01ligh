But after the war of Adrian, and the death of R. Akibah in
that war, when J udea was now in disturbance by the Romans,
Rabban Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, succeeding in the pre-
sidentship after Akibah, went with the Sanhedrim from Jafne
to Usha, nor was there ever after any return to J asne.

The Talmudistsi remember us of very many things trans-
acted at Usha. ‘⁶ WVhen they intercalated the year in Usha,
the first day, R. Ismael, the son of R. J ochanan Ben Brucha⁷
stood forth, and said according to the words of R. Joehanan
Ben N uri. Rabban Simeon Ben &samaliel said, ⁶ We were not
wont 130 do so in Jafne.’ On the second day, Ananias, the son
of J osi the Galilean, said according to the words ofR Akibah.
R. Simeon Ben Gamaliel said, ‘ So we were wont to do in
J athe? ’' This story is repeated in Rosh hashanah k, and
Nedarim ¹.

“ In m Usha it was decreed that a man should nourish his
little children3 that if a man make over his goods to his
children, he and h'is wife be maintained out of the1n‚” 850.

It¹¹ was determined also in Usha concerning the burning
the Truma, 111 some doubtful cases: of which see the place
quoted.

But that we be not more tedicus, let this story be for a
conclusion: “ Τ1100 wicked kingdom [of Rome] did sometime
decree a persecution against Israel: namely‚ that every 0110
preferring any to be an elder should be killed; and that
every 0110 that was preferred should be killed3 and that the
city in which any is preferred to eldership should be laid
waste; and that the borders within which any such promotion
is made, should be rooted out. What did Baba Ben J udah
do? He went out, and sat between two great mountains, and
between two great citios, and between two sabbath bouuds,

dained five elders, namely, 11. Meir, R. -Judah‚ R. Simeon, R.
Josi‚ and R. Eliezer Ben Simeon. Rabh Oia added also
R. Nehemiah. NVhen this came to be known to their enemies,
