SECT. I.—A few remarks apori the ›S'amaritan affairs.
1. Of the name qf the Outltites.

THAT the ⁴ Samaritans' are called ‘ Outhites' by the Jews
is unquesti011able2 Οἱ κατὰ μὲν τὴν “Εβραι’ωυ γλῶτταν Χου-
θαῖοι, κατὰ δὲ τὴν Ἑλλήνων Σαμαρεῖται, “ Thoseu that in the
Hebrew tongue are called Cuthaeam, in the language of the
Greeks are Sainaritans.'’

But why Outhites rather than Babylonians, Hamathites‚
Avites‚ &c.‚ is uncertain : for thence, as well as from Cutha,
were colonies transplanted into Samaria, 2 Kings xvii. 24:
nay, they were called Outhites even at that time, when a
great part of the Samaritan nation consisted of Jews.

I am apt to apprehensi there was some virulent design
even in the very name. The name of Oushites amongst the
Jews was most loathsome and infamous3 as they were not
only a hostile country, but a people accursesl, and, for their

title of the seventh Psalm there is no little severity of re-
proach hinted in the name Cassi. Something of the like na-
ture may be couched in the word Cawrlm‘m. For whereas
:rx-m may be the same with miv-⁷³2„ the letter m being
changed into Π in the Syriae dialect: it may be an easy
conjecturo, that the Jews, calling tho samaritanis (a nation
