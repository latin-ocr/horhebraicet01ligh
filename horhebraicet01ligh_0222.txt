ΙΙ. The word ‘Nl-m “ the wilderness,” denotes a champaign
country, where one man’s ground is not distinguished from
another’s by fences.

“Theye do not breed up smaller cattle in the land of
Israel, but in Syria they do. Hs& ³727 murman And in
the wfildemesses of the land qf Israel f.''' Where the Gloss
thus: “ They do not breed such cattle in the land of Israel,
that they seed not down the fields: now the fields in the land
of Israel (lo belong, without doubt, to some Israelite.” But
they fed in the deserts; that is, where field was not distin-
guished from field, but all was common. Hence you may
understand what is signified by the desert of Ziph, of Maon,
of Tekoah‚ &a ; namely, a region or country near to eitieS,
where also were scattered houses; but especially, eit-her
clmmpaism, where no fences were to make distinction of
lands; or mountainozcs, and that which was barren and with-
out husu-ovements.

ΙΙΙ. There is¹ no need to speak of the deserts that were

altogether desolate and without inhabitant3 such as the
deserts of Arabia, of Libya, &c.

Sam. ll .-Π“ῒ”1ι““ἵ“ ’ἾΞἿὮ The wilderness of Judah.

Pssmmps I shall be laughed at if Ι distinguish between
the wilderness of Judah and the wilderness of Judea. And
formerly such a distinction did deserve laughter3 but when
the name of idumea, as I have shewed, swallowed up a great·
part of Judea, then it was not only to be borne with, but
necessary also, to distinguish between the wilderness of J udah,
of which Josh. xv. 61, and the title of Psal. lxiii, and the wil-
derness of Judea where John baptized.

The title of that Psalm in the original Hebrew is thus,
³73³ss *3722 imvm, vri-35 amm ‘⁶ A Psah'n of David
when he was in the desert of Judah.³' But the Greek inter-
preters render it, ‘⁶ A Psalm of David when he was ἐν τῇ
ἐρήμῳ τῆς Ἰδουμαίας, in the wilderness of Idumeaf' And the
Vulgar, “ A l‘salm of David when he was in the desert of
l‹111mea:” aeting the part of no good iuterl'neterS, but of no
ill paraphrastes. So Jer ix. ἰός ῠήἾζῇ 1927] ΠΤιΠἾ ³727 Ἐπὶ
wammam„ καὶ ἐπὶ ’east- upon 1.‹1u111'e'a‚ an'd upon 'Edon1.”
