skilful than a diver, to fetch this secret from the bottom.
‘ Jordan is not Jordan above Jericho,' is a paradox that
vexes the Glossers themselves, much more therefore may
it me. One understands the thing according to the bare
letter; for “he that voweth (saith he) that he will not
drink of Jordan, may drink above J e1·icho.” Another under-
stands it of Jerioho, as being a bounds, yea, as the bounds
named below Jericho only; Josh. xviii. 20. We make no
tarrying upon the business. But if Jordan had such a limita-
tion, that Jordan was not abovep Je1·ich0,⁷‘7 περίχωρος Ἰορ-
δάνου, ‘ The region about J ordan: is to be understood in the
same limitation, namely, that it is only below J ericho. See

river Shihor, carrying blackness in its name, mayq be taken
for it, if it be any other3 but neither does this appear con—
cerning it.

While you see multitudes gathered together to John, and
gladly baptized in Jordan, without sear, without danger,
alas, how much was Jordan changed from that Jordan in
that story of Saligniac! “Jordan (saith her), in which place
Christ was baptized, is famous for a ruinous building. Here,
therefore, all we pilgrims went into the holy river, and washed
our bodies and our souls3 those from filth, and these from
sin3 a matter of very great joy and health, had not an un-
happy accident disturbed our joys. For a certain physician‚
a Frenehnian, of our company, an honest man, going some-
thing further into the river, was caught with a crocodile
