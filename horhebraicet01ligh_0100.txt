Bethany. Ἴ ΓΠ TW 2· Beth-kene.

BETHANY seems to be the same with ἿΞἾΠ rw: among the
Talmudists. Of which they write thus. Theyn treat in the
place, noted in the margin, concerning eating of fruits the
seventh year, and concerning ἾἾὨἛ Beor, of which we have
spoke beforeo. They inquire, How long one may eat of these
or the other fruits 3-Aud they state the business thus:
“ They eat Olives (say they) until the last ceases in Tekoa.
R. Eleazar saith, Until the last ceases in Gush Olialab’' (in
the tribe of Asher). “ They eat dry figs‚ until green figs cease
*1³27 1³³1 in Beth-kene. R. Judah saith, The green figs of
Beth-hene are not mentioned; unless in respect of the tenths;
as the tradition is, *naum *rt-iffi ΤΠ svn Ἶ,Ἦ 850. The
figs of Beth-hene, and the dates of Tubni‚ are bound to be
tithed,'' The Gloss is this3 “ They are not mentioned in the
schools among fruits, unless in respect of tithing.”' These
words are recited in Erubhin: whereP the word ὊἺἾ ΠἿΞ
Beth-kene is writ, ἾΞἾἾΠἾΞ Beth-jone, and '¹32th Tubni is writ
mmm chbina. “

Beth-laena certainly seems to be the same altogether with
our Bethanffi- and the name to be drawn from the word ἾἿΠΝ
Aheno, which signifies the “ dates of palm-trees‚” not come
to ripeness: as the UD also signifies “green-figS‚” that is,
such figs as are not yet ripe.

And now take a prospect a little of mount Olivet. Here
you may see olive-trees; and in that place is Gethsemane,
“The place of eil-presses.’' There you may see palm-trees
growing; and that place is called Bethany, ³:1⁵³ ΠἮ “ The
place of dates.” And we may observe in the gospcl-history,
how those that met Christ, as he was going forward from
Bethany, had branchos of palm-trees ready at hand. There
you may see fig-trees growing; and that place was called
Bethphage, “ The place of green-figs.”
