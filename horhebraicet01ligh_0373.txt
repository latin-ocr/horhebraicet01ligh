The pool of Siloam. 363

loam, was Gihon, ι Kings i. 333 ‘⁶ Bring ye him [Solonion]
down to Gihon.'' Targum, to ‘ Siloamz' Kimohiy, “ Gihon
is Siloam, and is called by a twofold name.'’ The tables
that describe Jerusalem speak of a ‘ mount Gihon 3' by what
warrant I cannot tell : if they had said the ‘somiein Gihon,'
it might have pleased better.

II. How that name ‘ Gihon' should pass into ‘Siloam,' is
diffieult to say. ‘⁸ The waters'' of it are mentioned, Isa. viii. 6,
to signify the reign and sovereignty of the house of David.
So the Targum and Sanhedrinz. “ Rabh J oseph saith, If there
had been no Targum of this Scripture, we had not known
the sense of it, which is this: Forsomueh as this people is
weary of the house of David, whose reign hath been gentle
as the flowing· of the waters of Siloam, which are gentle,'' &c.
Therefore it was not in vain that David sent his son Solomon
to be anointed at Gihon or Siloam, for he might look upon
those watersas some type or shadow by which the reign of
his house should be deciphered.

III. The situation of it was behind the west wall, not far
from the corner that pointed towards the south-west. Ἔπειτα

πρὸς vo'rov ὑπὲρ τὴν Σιλωὰμ ἐπιστρέφου πήγηυ, ἔνθεν τε πάλιν ·

ἐκκλίνον πρὸς ἀνατολήν· “ Thea wall bent southward above
the fountain of Siloam, and then again inclined towards the
east.'’

The waters os this spring, by different streams, derived
themselves into two fish-pools, as seems hinted in 2 Chron.
xxxii. 30 : “ Hezekiah stopped the upper water-course of
Grihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the
city of David ;’' where a MS. of the Targum, siut-,272 n* ,7ρῦ
sinu *¹172 2 instead of Ἣῖ) we should write ἾἾὯ of tlte uaters:
parm: ῙἾΠΠἾ &was-m Ι suspect that sor ῙἛἾἿῸΞ, should
be written ΓΣΠἾὮΞ in pipes : “He stopped up the upper waters
of Gihon, and brought them in pipes.'' But to let this pass,
that which I would observe is this: that there was a water-
course from Gihon or Siloam, which was called the “ upper
water-course,'' which flowed into a pool, called also the “ upper
pool,” Isa. xxxvi. 2; and, as it should seem, the ‘⁴ old pool‚''
Isa. xxii. 11 ; by ‚Iosephus ‘⁸ the pool'' or “ fish-pool of Solo-
mon ;” for so he, in the place before cited.
