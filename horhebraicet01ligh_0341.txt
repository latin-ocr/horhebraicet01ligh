T lere Great Plain. 331

SECT. lV.—Me'ya πεδίον· The yram plain : tlce
Scythopolitan passaye there.

Or this great plain, which took in the whole breadth of
the country of Manasseh from Jordan towards the west, a
very long way, J osephus frequently speaks, Describing the
situation and portion of Ephraim and Manasseh‚ he thus
expresseth himself:

‘HI δ’ Ἐφραίμου φυλὴ τὴν ἄχρι Γαδάρων ἀπὸ Ἰορδάνου πο-
ταμοῦ μηκυνομένην ἔλαχεν, εὐρείαν δὲ ὅσον ἀπὸ Βεθήλων εἷς τὸ
μέγα τελευτᾷ πεδίον· “ The tribe of Ephraim extended itself
in length from the river Jordan to Gada1·a” [Gazarah‚ or
Gezer, J osh. xvi. 3, and xxi. 21] 3 ‘⁶ in breadth, from Betheh
and ends at the Great Plain.''

Τῆς Μανασσήτιδος οἱ ἡμίσεις, διο. “ The half tribe of Ma-
nasseh extends itself in longitude from Jordan to the city
Dor. Πλάτος δὲ ἐπὶ Βηθσάνων, ἣ νῦν Σκυθόπολις καλεῖται· But
in latitudo [from Ephraim] it reacheth to Beth-shean, which is
now called Scythopolis? So that that μέγα πεδίον, or ‘ great
plain,q to those that were journeying from Galilee, began from
Beth—shean‚ and extended itself in latitude to the confines os
Ephraim. Hence that which we meet with in the same J 0-
sephusfoovm εἰς τὸ μέγα πεδίον, οὗ κεῖται κατὰ τὸ πρόσωπον
πόλις Βηθσάνη· “ They that passed over Jordan came into
the great plain, before which the city Bethsan lies ;'' or as
it is in 1 Mace. v. 52, ‘⁶ They went over Jordan into the
great plain before Beth—shean.'’

In the Book of J udith, chap. i. 8, it is called τὸ μέγα πεδίου
Ἐσδρηλώμ· “The great plain of Esdrelom :’' that is, in truth‚
“the great valley of J ezreel.'' So Jezreel, in the place above
quoted, 1 Kings iv. 12, by the Greek interpreters is rendered
Ἐσραέ. Insomuoh, that when it is said of Judah aud his
army (for he it is whom this passage concerns), that in his
return from the land of Grilead he passed over Jordan into
this ‘⁴ great plain‚'' and that (as it should seem) not very far
from Beth-shean; it is evident that the great and common
passage over Jordan was hereabout ¹¹, by which not only the
Scythopolitans went over from their country on this side
