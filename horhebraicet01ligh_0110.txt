done by them: in three of which the chief council consented
to them, but in the other three they consented not?q Those
things, concerning which they opposed them not, were
these :—

Ῐ. ΞῬΠ ³7: ΕἾῖἳξΤϊ ΓΞΌἾὩ “ They ingrafted‚ or folded,
together, palm-trees every day.” Here is need of a long
commentary, and they produce one, but very obscure. The
business of the men ofJericho was about palm-tree53 which
they either joined together, and mingled males with femaleS,
or they ingrasted, or (as they commonly say) inoculated the
more tender sprouts of the branches into those, that were
older. So much indulgence was granted them by the wise
men concerning the time, wherein these things are done,
which, elsewhere, would scarely have been suffered3 unless,

palms, required it.

thered-in their sheaves, before the sheaf [offirst-fi‘uits] was
offered :'’ and this, partly, because of the too early ripeness
of their corn in that place; aud, partly, because their corn
grew in a very low valley, and therefore it was not accounted
fit to be offered unto the Mincha, or daily sacrifice. See the
Gloss.

The three things, concerning which the wisc men consented
not to them, were these 2-—
