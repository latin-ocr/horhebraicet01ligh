Court of {lae Gentiles. 65

Gamaliel³‚ walking in the C‘om‘t of the Gentiles (ΠἾΞΠ ἿΠΞ),
saw a heathen woman, and blessed concerning her.''

Andk those that were excommunicated and lamented.
“Alll that entered into the mount of the Temple, enter the
right-hand way, and go about: but they go out the left-hand
way: except him, to whom any accident, happens: for he
goes about to the left hand. To him that asks, ‘that is the
matter with you, that you go about to the left handZ—he
answerS, ‘Because I lament: ² and he replies to him, ‘He
that dwells in this temple comfort thee.’ Or, ‘ Because I am
excommunicated? and to him he replies, ‘ He that dwells
in this house, put it into their heart to receive thee.' '⁵

And not seldom those that are unolean. Yea, he that
carries away the scape-goat might enter into the very court,
although he were then unclean. “ Ism he polluted‚ who is
to take away the goat? He entereth unclean even into the
court, and takes him away.''

“ Then greatest space of the Gourt of the Gentiles was on
the south3 the next to it, on the east3 the third, on the
north ; but the least space was on the west. Of that place,
where the space was greater, the use was greater also.”

In⁰ the wall compassing this space were five gates: and
within, joining to the wall, were ἸἾΟΒ VD 0⁸:537 wat:
“double galleries” or “halls,'' which yielded (lelightful walks,
and defence also from rains.

Therep was only one gate eastward, and that was called,
the Gate of Shushang because the figure of Shushan, the
metropolis of Persia, was engraven in it, inq token of sub-
jection. Inr this gate sat a council of three and twenty.
At the gate, on both sides, were D‘ffl'l slcops ,· and the whole
gallery-walk, on this east side, was called “ solomon's porcl1.’'

On the south were two gates, both called the Gate of
Huldah: of the reason of the name we are not solicitous.
These looked towards Jerusalem, 01· Aera. The hall οι·
gallery, gracing this south side, was calledS Στοὰ Βασιλικὴ,
