of the chamber;” and “ Ab Beth Dine [pff Πᾞ ²²2². the
next in rank to the president]‚ on his right hand, and the
elders on both sides, in a half circle.''

How the Sanhedrim was driven from this chamber, and
when and why, we observe elsewhere.

next to this, westwarslly: “where was a well, and a pulley:
whence water was supplied to the whole court.'’

III. Contiguous to this was the “ gate of waters 3⁹³ so
called, either because the water, to be poured out upon the
altar, on the feast of Tabm‘nacles, was brought in through
this gate3 or because the water-course, conveyed into the
Temple from the fountain Etam‚ went along through this
gate into the chamber of the spring. “ Abai saith g, That
fountain was deeper than the pavement of the court three
and twenty cnbitS.'’—“ And I think (saith the author of the
siloss), that the fountain Etam was the same with the waters
of N ephtoah, of which mention is made in the book of J oshua,
XV. 9; from thence it descends and slopesh into the east and

“ the chamber of the counsello1·s:'' where there was a ses-
sions of the priests, consulting about the affairs of the Tem-
ple and Service. The ‘wood-chamber‘ seems to be called
so upon this account, because the wood was-conveyed hither,
after the search about it was made in the ⁶ chamber of wood'
(which was in the corner of the Women's Court,) whether
there were any wornis in it : that which was found fit for the
altar was laid-up here, that it might be more in readiness.

and, after that, 71373771'7 '5le “ the gate of kindling.”
