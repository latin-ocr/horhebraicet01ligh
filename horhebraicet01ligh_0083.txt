CH A P. XXXIII.
Tlce Court itseff.

“ The floorv of the whole sacred earth was not- level‚ but
rising : when any went on, from the east gate of the Court of
the Gentiles, to the farthest part of the elaea—he went all in
a level. From the Chal, he went up into the Gourt of the
Women‚ twelve steps‚—whe1·eof every step was half a, cubit
in height. Along the whole Court of the Women he went
in a level; and thence went up into the Court of Israel fif-
teen steps, every step half a cubit in height.’'

The q Oourt of Israel was a hundred and thirty-five cubits
in length, eleven in breadth.

Through all this court one went in a leve13 and thence
went up into the Oourt of the Priests by one step of a cubit
high: on which was set a pulpit (where the choir of the Le-
vites that sang stood), and in it were three steps, each half
a cubit. Therefore, the Court of the Priests is found to be
two cubits and a half higher than the Court of Israel.

The s Oourt of the Priests was a hundred thirty-five cubits
in length, eleven in breadth. And they divided the heads of
the beams between the Com-t of Israel and the Oourt of the
Priests.

They went through the Oourt of the Priests in a level;
and the same they did along the space by the altar, and
along the space between the altar and the Pronaon, or the
‘ Porch of the Temple? Thither they ascended by twelve steps,
each half a cubit high. The floor of the Pronaon and the
Temple was all level: and was higher than the floor of the east
gate of the Oourt of the Gentiles, two and twenty cubits.

The length of the whole court was a hundred eighty-seven
cubits‚ that is, from east to west. To wit,
