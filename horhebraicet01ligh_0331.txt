Emmaus. Timnath. Mozmt Gilead. 321

set up by Jacob for a witness of the covenant betwixt him
and Laban. (Gen. xxxi.)

We read of something not unlike it set up by Joshua
near Shechem, in testimony of the covenant betwixt the
people and God, J osh. xxiv. 26. Now, therefore, who can
doubt but that J oshua was buried near Shechem? For when
that place was particularly bequeathed and set out by Jacob
for his son Joseph, who, of the whole stock and lineage of

J oseph, could justlier inherit that part of the country than
J oshua?

He was buried on the north side of the hill Gaash, in his
own ground. Might not that hill be also called Gilead,
upon the account of that pillar of witness that was built
there a little from Sychem? whence the foot of the hill, and
the hill itself beginning to rise (if it were northward, which
we suppose), then it might very well reach not far from that
place where this matter of Gideon was transacted. For,
whereas the field wherein the battle was, was within the
tribe of Manasaeh, contiguous to mount Ephraim, and Gi-
deon proclaims that whosoever were afraid should depart from
mount Gilead; we can, perhaps, think of no more proper
sense wherein this mount Gilead can be taken, than that
that part of mount Ephraim was so called from the pillar of
testimony placed on the south side of it, when the common
name for it was the hill Gaash.
