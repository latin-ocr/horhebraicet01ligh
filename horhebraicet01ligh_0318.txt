SAREPTA in the story of Elijah‚ 1 Kings xvii, is written

in Hebrew ΠΞἚ Tzarepleatli and with the same letters in
Obad. V.er 20: and therefoie it m ι) be reason ὼίγ inquired,
whethe1 it be one and the same place. Indeed there would
hardly be any doubt in it, but that the Jews ordinarily by

ΠΞἾΞ, understand Famae,- and by ἾἾΞᾯ Sepharad. which by
the prophet is used in the very same verse Spain. The
words of the prophet aie veiy variously rendered3 and yet
in all that variety, nothing hinders but that Zarephath there
may be understood of the Zarephath mentioned in the Kings.
For whether the passage concern the captivity's being de-
tained in Zarephath, or the captivity's possessing the land
to Zarephath (for in that variety chiefly the words are ex-
pounded), in either sense it may well enough be, that the
‘Sarepta that belongs to Zidon' may be the soene of the
affair. As to the former, if we compare but that passage
ooneerning Tyre, the sister of Sidon, Amos i. 9, and withal
the potenoy and dominion of the Sidonians, it may not be
improbable but that the Israelites might be captived in
Sarepta of Sidon. And as to the latter, whereas in the verse
immediately before, the diseourse is of the possession of the
mount of Esau, of the fields of Ephraim, Samaria2 and Gilead,
and then there is mention of possessing the landos Canaan
as far as Zarephath, who would seek Zarephath in France,
and not in some neighbouring place, according to all the rest
os the places there named, which were all very near? Let me
add moreover, that whereas there is mention of possessing
the land of the Canaanites “ even unto Zarephath,'' the Greek
interpreters will tell you who those Canaanites were that are
distinguished from the rest of the nations in tho land of
Casnaany, viz. the Phoenicium, Josh. v. 1. And by the ‘kings
