nourish cocks throughout the whole land of Israel, for the
sake of purity: nor is there in it a house for shutting out
suspected of the leprosy: nor is it polluted with leprosy: nor
is it become any way a city to be cursed for idolatry,'' &c.

‘⁶ Nevern did serpent or scorpion harm any one within
Jerusalem. Nor did ever any one say to his neighbour,
‘ The place wherein Ι am entertained at Jerusalem is too
strait for me.'”

“ There⁰ is no anathema at Jerusalem, nor hath any man
stumbled. Nor hath a fire or a ruin happened there: nor
hath any one said to his neighbour, ‘ I found not a hearth to
roast my passover,‘’ or ‘ I found not a bed to lie on.' In it
they do not plant trees, except gardens of roseS, which were
there from the days of the former prophets: they do not
nourish in it peacocks, or cocks, much less hogs,⁷' &a

The fathers of the traditionsp give this reason, why they
do not allow gardens in the city: “ They make no gardens
or paradises in'Jerusalem, ΝΓΓΡΟ Dium because of the
stink.” The Gloss, ‘² Because of the stink from weeds, which
are thrown out; and it is a custom to dung gardens, and
from thence comes a stink.'’

The same Gloss, in the same place, gives this reason also,
why they might not keep eocks: “It is also forbidden the
Israelites to keep cocks in Jerusalen1” (the priests may no
where do it), “ because of the holy things. For there they
have eaten the flesh of the peace-offerings, and thank-offer-
ings. And it is customary for dunghill cocks to serape dung--
hills, and thence ,perhaps they might rake up the bones of
creeping things3 whence those holy things, which are to be
eaten, might be polluted.”

Garslens without the -city were very frequent, and they
stretehing ont a good way from the very walls of the city.
Hence that in J osephus (1, concerning the hazard Titus ran,
whilst he rode about the city to spy it. Τῷ δὲ, πρόσω μὲν
ἧν χωρεῖν ἀδύνατον, ἐκτετάφρευτο γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους περὶ τὰς
