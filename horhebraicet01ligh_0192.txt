Maja, Amon, and Mazi (R. Mena saith, So it was called
anciently‚ but now Susitha): Ainosh, En Teraa, Ras, Berin,
J ion, Jadot, Caphar, Charob, Chaspia, and Caphar Tsemach.
These cities are permitted in the borders, Nebi, Tsur,
Tsijar, Gasmi, Zivian, Jagdi‚ Chatam‚ Debab, Charbatha,
and Cheraecah” (or “Debab‚ and its wildermss, and its for-
tffioatz'on”).

You see the name ἾἾΞζ Tsur, here once and again, of
which we have spoken before: let us add these words else-
where: “ 10 will walk before the Lord in the land of the
living: and are there not other lands of the living besides
'l‘snr and her companions‚ —and Caesarea and her com-
panions3”

Of ΠΌΕ ἾΞΞ Caphar Tsemceclm there is mention also in
the plaee first cited, col. 3, in these words: “ Rabbi looseth
Bethshan. Rabbi looseth Caesarea. R. looseth Beth-Gu-
brim. Rabbi looseth Caphar Tsemaolf' (from the obligation⁷
as it seemeth, of the Demai). ‘⁶ Rabbi permitted to take
herbs, in the end of the seventh year: but all were against
him. He said to them, Come, and let us judge of the matter.
⁸ It is written' (concerning Hezekiah) ‘ And he beat in pieces
the brazen serpent.’ What l was not any one righteous from
Moses unto his times, who did this? But God reserved that
crown for him, that he might be erowned with it: and Grod
hath reserved this erown for us, that we may be crowned
with it.’' Egregium vero factum et spolia ampla, διαὶ)

These things are something obscure, and do require light.
