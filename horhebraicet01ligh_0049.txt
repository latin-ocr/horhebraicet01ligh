Lydda. 39

phon at Lydda. We read¹ also of a fast enjoined at Lydda
for the obtaining of rain, and Tarphon the moderator of the
solemnity. The stories of this place are infinite ς we will

gather a feW.
Helenam the queen celebrated the feast of tabernacles at

L ·dda.

>R Eliezarn and R. J oshua were sometime present in the
same place at the feast of dedication: but being not enough
satisfied concerning the fast at that time enjoined, one went
to the bath‚—the other. to the barber’s shop.

Here0 it was, that Ben Satdah was surprised and taken,
and brought before the Sanhedrim‚ and stoned.

There is also very frequent mention of Papus and Lulienus‚
brethren, slain at Lydda by the Roman kingdom: “ Ther day
ἶἸἾἾἾΩ is the day wherein Lulienus and Papus were slain.'' ἶἾἾἾἾτΔ
with the Jerusalem writers is D'fflwwffi with the Babylonian:
who relate. that these brethren were slain &ip-5592, “inq Lao-
dicea‚'’ as one would guess. But ἶῬἾἾίῬ, saith the Gloss, ‘⁶ is
Lydda: forr '15³7 ἾᾸἹἾΠ, the slain of Lydda are every where
mentioned—And these (saith the Gloss) were put to death
for the king's daughter, who was found slain3 and there was
a rumour the Jews had killed her. When, therefore, a sharp
decree was decreed against the J ews. these two stood forth,
and delivered Israel. For they said, We slew her; therefore,
the king put them only to death.”

SinceS it was not lawful to intercalate the year any where
but in J udea, “ at great many went to Lydda out of the school
of the Rabbi’' (J udah H aocodesh, viz. out of Galilee), “ that
they might intere-alate : but a certain evil eye met them, and
they all died together. After that, they removed the inter-
calation of the year out of J udea into Galilee.'' And a little
after: “ R. Jeremiah asked before R. Zeira, Is not Lydda a
part of J udea? Yes, saith he. Wherefore, then, do they not
transact the intercalation of the year there 3—1300ause they
are obstinate, and unskilful in the laW.''
