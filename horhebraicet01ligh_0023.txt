3'2'03 because that lake, having no great depth, but very
much dried in the summer-time, was grown over with thorns
and bushes. 3. 7200, from whence the common name Samo-
chonitis„ the letters 73 and 2 being changed in 5:20 and
imo.

V. ΝΠῙἊΠἻ Nym Perhaps the samby sea. Which fits very
well to the lake of Sirbon, joining the commentary of Dio-
dorus Siculus b. For he relates, that that lake, for the most
part, is so covered with sand, that it hath often deceived and
supplanted travellers, yea, whole armies, thinking it to be
firm land.

VI· Dl'llvw'l Nn* We have nothing to say of this, besides
this obse1·vation‚—-that since it is also called by the same
Gemarists ΠἿἾῘἎΠἿ, the guttural Π seems to be melted into '¹ ;
which is not unusual to the dialect of the nation, so to

by rivers gathered together.'' It was, therefore, of a later
date. Concerning it, see the sixty-eighth chapter.

After these seas, mentioned by the Talmudists, hear also
no lean story of theirs concerning the fish: “R. ChaninahC
Bar R. Abhu said, Seven hundred kinds of clean fish, and
eight hundred kinds of clean locusts‚ and of birds an infinite
number, travelled with Israel into Babylon, and returned
when Israel returned, except the fish &2me But how did
the fish traveIZ R. Houna Bar J oseph saith, ³³72 :nrm ἾἾἻ
t-hey travelled by the way of the deep, and by the deep they
came back.’' Surely it requires a Jewish invention (which is
