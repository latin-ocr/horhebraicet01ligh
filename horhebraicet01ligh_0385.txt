impart something of moment 130 Vespasian himself alone.
Vespasian having commanded all out cf the roem, except
Titus and two other of his friends, Josephus accosts him
thus, Νέρωυί με πέμπεις; “ Are you sendiny me to Nero ,9 Thou
thyself, Ο Vespasian, shalt be Caesar and emperor, thou and
this thy son,’' 850.

The Talmudists attribute such a prediction to Rabban
Jochanan Ben Zaccai, in the tracts before quoted; viz.
“Rabbano J ochanan Ben Zaccai was carried out in a coffin‚
as one that is dead, out of Jerusalem. He went to Vespa-
sian's army and said, Where is your kingp‘? They went and
told Vespasian, There is a certain J ew desireth admission to
you. Let him come in, saith he. When he came in, he
said, &3¹70 Ἴθι) sebe αὕτη 7²73? sebe Lm, o kiny,
live, Ο kin-off* [So in Gittin; but in Midrash, Live ἾἾᾶὮ

lute me as if I were king, but Ι am not so3 and the king will
hear this, and judge such a one to death. To whom he,

destroyed but by α λ’ἱηρῖς haenel,- as it is written, ‘ Lebanon
shall fall by a mighty one,’'' Isa. x. 34.

To which of these two, or whether indeed 130 1)ο111, the
glory of this prediction ought to be attributed, I leave it to-
the reader to judge ; returning to the times of the Greeks.

The army and forces of the enemy being defeated under
the conduct of Judah the Maccabee, the people begin 10

Temple, and the hely things. The story of which we meet
with 1 Mace. iv. 43, &c. and in ,J osephus (1, whose words are
