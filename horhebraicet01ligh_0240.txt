Herodotus* goes forward3 Ἀπὸ ταύτης (Καδύτιος) τὰ ἐμ-
πόρια τὰ ἐπὶ θαλάσσης μέχρι Ἰηνύσου πόλιός ἐστι τῆς Ἀραβίας.
ἀπὸ δὲ Ἰηνύσου αὖτις Συρίων μέχρι Σερβωνίδος λίμνης· “ From
Cadytis‚ the sea mart towns as far as JenysuS‚ belong to
Arabia; from Jenysus onward to the Serbon lake belong to
the Syrians.'' Words obscure enough3 especially which was
the city Jenysusy: the Talmudistsz indeed mention ἶυὋἯζγ
-ιῙεηνμςή, among the towns which they say are wrm: in tho
confines: bnt the situation does not agree. But we will not
pursue the matter in this place.

The Gloss writes thus; “ They are always tenths: both
in the time of the feasts‚ and in the time when there are no
feasts. But moneys found in the mount of the Temple were
common, even in the time of the seasts. For it is supposed,
those moneys fell from them [or were lost} in the mount of
the Temple3 and thereupon they are common. But why
were they tenths in Jerusalem in the time of the feasts'3 And
why is it not. said, That they had fallen from them there be-
fore the feast, as we say of the mount of the Temple? Be-
cause the streete of Jerusalem were swept every day; and if
moneys had boen lost there before the feast, they who swept
the street had found them before. But the mount of the
Temple had no need to be swept every day: for dirt and
<lust remained not there; because the mount was shelving:
and nmreover, it was not lawful for any to enter there with
his shoes, or with «lust on his feet.”'
