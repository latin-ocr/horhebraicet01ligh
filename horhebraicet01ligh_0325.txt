Emmaus. 315

ΙΙ. The Syriae, Arabio, and Persian interpreters write the
name in the evangelist with an y at the begin-ning3 the Sy-
riae and Persian D'lNDy. So also the Syriae in 1 Maec. iii.
40. But the Arabio emer, the Talmudists omnis, with Ν
in the beginning. Indeed, in Talin. Bab. in Erachin, fol. 10. 1,
it is written ΟἾΝΌἺΜ but in the Misnaioth, printed by itself,
it is ΟἾΝῺΝ. So it is in Succah, fol. 51. 5.

ΙΙΙ. J osephus commonly renders Chammath of Tiberias
(a place so called from the hot baths) by Ἀμμαοῦς, Ammaus ;

but we can hardly suppose they were warm, if we consider

Rabban Jochanan should make his abode. if not in J abneh ἓ
for that is the place they commonly allot to him; but this is
not a place to (lispute of such matters.

“ Pel-veneruntt Nicopolim,'' &c “They came to Nico-
polis: now Nicopolis is a city in Palestine. This the book
of the gospel calls Emmaus, while it was yet a village. There,
through the plenty of good waterS‚ and all necessary provi-
sions, they enjoyed a good comfortable night.”

This author, upon this occasion, quotes some passages
out of sozomen, in the sixth book of the Tripartite History,
which are in his fifth book, chap. 203 wherein the waters at u
Emmaus are celebrated not only for their plenty and plea-
santness, but as they were wonder-fully wholesome and me-
dicinal. For thus he: ‘⁴ There is a city in Palestine, which
now hat-h the name of Nicopolis, of which the holy gospel
makes mention as of a village (for then it was so), καὶ Ἐμμᾶ
