There is somewhat there also, which how to reconcile with
Josephus, it is not easy to shew: for it is said,

Fromd Neapolis to AElia 30 miles,

To Eleutheropolis . . . 20 miles,

To Ascalon ..... 24 miles.
XVhere from AElia or Jerusalem to Ascalon run out only 44
miles3 whereas J osephus saith of Ascalon, that it was τῶν
Ἱεροσυλύμωυ εἴκοσι πρὸς τοῖς πεντακοσίοις ἀπέχουσα σταδίους,
“ distante from Jerusalem 520 furlongs‚'' or 65 miles. This
brcach is a little filled up by this; that New Ascalon was
nearer to Jerusalem than the old by sixteen miles, as Ben-
jamin relates

Whether Betaron were the same with ἾΠἮ Βείαν, where
that horrible slaughter was under ΒΘΗ Cozba, we will not
dispute here: there is no doubt to be made but Lianmia is
illy writ for J amnia. And now let us follow Antoninus to
Pelusium :—
Rhinocolura

Ostracena . . . 24 miles,
Cassio . . . . 26 miles,
Pentascino . . . 20 miles,
Pelusio . . . . 20 miles.

Which how they agree with Pliny, who numbers only sixty-
five miles from Pelusium to the ending of Arabia, viz. to
the Sil-bon, on which Rhinocolura borders, I shall not take
upon me to say. This I have said elsewhere, that it is a
wonder that some maps should place the Sirbon between
Cassius and Pelusium, when the contrary manifestly appears
both here and in Pliny and Strabo, Perhaps they took the
error from Ptolemy, or at least from his interpreter, in whom

Cassius is in latitude‚ degr. 31. 15 ε but the breaking out of
the Sirbon in 31. 10.
