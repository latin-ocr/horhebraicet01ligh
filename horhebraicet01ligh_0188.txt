032332 “In Adam,'' the marginal hath Ξᾙὶᾖῗῦ “ From Adam.”
You may very fitly apply both readings.

Adam was the centre, where the waters parted: here was
the station of the ark of the covenant, now ready to enter
Jordan. Hence the Psalmist, Βᾙξὶᾉ ἶΞῖζᾶ ἰῖΠδῖ The taber-
nacle which lae had fixed in Adam, Psalm lxxviii. 60. There-
fore, the textual reading 03232 “ in Adam,'' holds well; be-
cause there was the centre of tlie cutting in two of the waters:
but the marginal reading Εᾞζῇᾨ “ fl’om Adam,'' does more-
over add light, because the gathering those waters together
on a heap was far above it.

“R. J ochanan saith Υ, Adam is a city, and Zaretan is a city,
and they are distant from one another twelve miles.” From
Adam to Zaret-an, were the waters dried up3 from Zaretan
and upwards, they stood on a heap. Adam was in Perea,
over-against J ericho; Zaretan was in the land of Manasseh
on this side Jordan. It is called Zarthanah‚ 1 Kings iv. 12,
and is defined to be near Beth—shean, which was the furthest
bounds of the land of Manasseh northward. The brazen
vessels of the Temple are said to be cast in the plain of J or-
dan, in the clay ground between Zaretan (on this side Jordan)
and Succoth (beyond it), 1 Kings vii. 46. Therefore, the words
cited in Joshua, 313-535 '¹322 aasz: rap-1 :risza aba? ,amp
far off* from Adam, which is beside Zaretan, are so to be
understood, as not so much to denote the nearness of Adam
and Zaretan, as to intimate that the heaping up of the waters
was by Zaretan. They are to be rendered in this sense, “ And
the waters that came down from above stood together3 they
rose up into one heap, in a very long distance from the city
Adam,'' namely, to that distance, which is by Zaretan.

Adam and Zaretan, on this and the other side, were both
something removed from Jordan : but they are named in that
story, because there the discourse is of the time, when Jordan
contained not itself within its own channcl, but had overflown
its banks.
