worthy our observation with respect to heresies of this kind.
Should this Capernaum be the same (as probably it is) with
that Capernaum which we meet with so frequently in the
evangelistS, it is something observable what is said of it,

“ Thou, Oapernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
brought down to hell.”

SEeT. V.—Some skort remarks upon Cana, John ii. 2.

ΙΤ is very disputable which should be the first letter of the
word Cana, whether [D] Caph or [p] Koph, for we find both.

I. ΠΒΡ Kana& with the initia] letter Koph [PL is a city in
the tribe of Asher, J osh. xix. 28 3 where the Greek for Kauale,
have Καυθάν· and MS. Alex. Κανά.

II. *1³37 Kene, a word not very much differing in the sound,
occurs amongst the Talmudists ¹, ἾΞἾΓ) z727 5372: ³:³7 ΠἛἾ ἾΞἾ
ἾΠἾἾΠῖΩἸΠΊ “ Rabbi and his Sanhedrim, having numbered
votes, pronounced Keni, clean.⁷'—Gloss ε “ Keni was a place
of doubtful estecm, reckoned amongst the unclean'' [that is,
a place of the Gentiles]; “ but in the days of R. Judah Hac—
codesh, it came under trial, and they pronounced it clean.’'

ΙΙΙ. W'e find Κανὰ κώμη in Josephus, but the situation
not mentioned: Antiochus¹¹ being slain” [viz. when he fought
with the Arabian king]‚ τὸ στράτευμα φεύγει εἰς Κανὰ κώμην,
“ his army fied to the town Kana.'' This is hardly our Cana,
as may in some measure appear in J osephus's context.

IV. But further he speaks in ‘ His Own Life ⁰‚' of κώμη τῆς
Γαλιλαίας ἢ προσαγορεύεται Κανά· “ Cana in Galilee.'’ As for
its situation, as far as can be collected from Josephus, we
discuss that in another treatise, and shew that. it is not far
from that place where the river Jordan dischargeth itself
into the sea of Gennesaret; so that between this Cana and
Capernaum, there seems to be almost the whole length of
that sea.

V. But it must not bc forgotten that m: Gamala, begin-
ning with the letter Caph, is met with in J uchasin ¹³3 the
words these: ΟἾΕΨἾΞΠ ΠΝ animm ‘⁴ In the end of the chap-
