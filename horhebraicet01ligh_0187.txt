Gilead. ConcerningS which, see Joseplmst, and the First
Book of Maccabees, v. 26.

While we speak of the difference between Bezer and Boz-
rah, we cannot pass by a simple example of this thing, pro-
pounded by the Babylonian Talmudists. “ Theu prince of
Rome” [viz. Samael, the angel of death, as the G‘loss tells
us] “ did formerly commit a threefold error 3 as it is written,
‘ Who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah ξ’
In this matter he eris, because there is no refuge but in Be-
zer, and he' betook himself to Bozrah,” &c.

Auranitis.—Josephusy sometimes calls it ‘ Abranitis.’—
“ Oaesar (saith he) gave to Herod [the Great] Τράχωνα, καὶ
Βαταναίαν, καὶ Ἀβρανῖτιν· Trachon, and Batanea, and Abra-
nitis;’' and that, that he should restrain and subdue the rob-
bers, who most miserably vexed those countries, &c.

Adam and Zaretan, Josh. iii.

I SUSPECT a double error in some lnaps, while they place
these two towns in Perea3 much more, while they place them
at so little a distance.

We do not deny, indeed, that the city Adam was in Pe-
rca3 but Zaretan was not so. Of Adam is mention, J osh. iii.
