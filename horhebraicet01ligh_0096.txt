Moloch,—⁷yet so much of the filthiness, and of the abomin-
able name remained, that even now it did as much bear to
the life the representation of hell, as it. had done before.

It was the common sink of the whole city; whither all
filth, and all kind of nastiness‚ met. lt was, probably, the
common burying-plaee of the city <if so be, they did now
bury within so small a distance from the city). “ They shall
bury in Tophea until there be 110 111016 any place‚'' Jer. vii. 32.
And there was there also a continual 1116, whereby bones, and
other filthy things, were consumed, lest they might offend or
infect the city. “ There was a tradition according to the
school of Rabban J ochanan Ben Zaccai. Theret are two
palm-trees in the vallcy of Ben-Hinnom‚ between which a

did some work, or it is called ⁶ the valley of Jehoshaphat’ be-
