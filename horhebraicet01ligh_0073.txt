Gir-dle of tke city. 63

ceived, if you begin Nehemiah’s delineation at any other place
than where we have, To these may be added, the situation
of Siloam, of which those things, spoken in Josephus and
the Scriptum, can in no manner be said, if you reckon it to
bc near Sion.

Let us add also the processions of the choir, Neh. xii. 31.
They went up upon the wall, and went forward on the right
hand to the Dung-gate, the Fountain-gate, the citya of David,
&a ver. 37. Let those words, “ They went forward on the
right hand,'' ver. 31, be observed: which could not be, unless
according to the procession which we have laid· down‚—if so
be they went up on the wall on the inside of the wall, which
it is rough and strange not to think.

The other part of the choir went on the left hand, towards
the south west, and to the gate of Ephraim, and the Old--
gate, and the Fish-gate, &e ver. 29. Of the gate of Ephraim
nothing was said in the delineation given chap. iii. Men-
tion also is made of it, 2 Kings xiv. 133 where the Coi-ner-
gate is also spoken of 3 concerning which, also, here is nothing
said.

In Nehemiah, seems to be understood that place, where
formerly was a gnte of that na111e,-—but now, under the
second Temple, was vanished.

go forth to Israel. The other saith, DLJWL'U mmm& mimo,
Because thence should go forth sear to the nations of the
world.”

“ Itc is a traditiond received by all, that the place, where
David built an altar iu the threshing-floor of Araunah, was
the place where Abraham built his, upon which he bound
Isaac; where Noah built his, when he went out of the ark :
