The K enites. 283

SECT. IV.-lee Kenites.

OF the same rank were the Kenites, th‘e Kenizzites‚ Cad-
monites: by original indeed Canaanites‚ but so named from
some Cain, and KenaZ, and Cadmon. men of famous renown
in those families. If so be the Cadmonites were not so
called from their antiquity, or rather from their habitation

The masters of the traditions do not agree among them-
selves what to resolve concerning these nations, In the J 0-
rusalem Talmudists you have these passages: “ Youry fathers
