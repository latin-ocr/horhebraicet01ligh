CHAP. LXXIII.
Of tlte Situation of Tiberias.

WHEN I read Pliny of the situation of this city, and com-
pare some things which are said by Josephus and the Tal-
mudists with him, I cannot but be at a stand what to re-
solve upon here. Pliny speaks thush of the situation of it:
“The lake [of Genesar] is compassed round with pleasant
towns: on the east, Julias and Hipp0; on the south, Tari-
chea, by which name some call the lake also3 on the west,
Tiberias, healthful for its warin xvaters.”

Consulti the maps, and you see Tiberias in them seated, as
it were, in the middle shore of the sea of Gennesaret, equally
distant almost from the utmost south and north coasts of
that sea. Which seems well indeed to agree with Pliny, but
illy with J osephus and his countrymen.

I. J osephus asserts that Hippo (in Perea, i. e. the country
on the other side Jordan) is distant from Tiberias only thirty
furlongS. For speaking to one J ustus, a man of Tiberias,
thus he saith, ‘H δὲ σὴ πατρὶς, ῶἸοῦστε, κειμένη ἐν τῇ Γεννησα-
ρίτιδι λίμνῃ, καὶ ἀπέχουσα μὲν Ἵππου στάδια τριάκοντα, &Q
“ Thyk native country, Ο J ustus, lying upon the lake of Gen-
nesaret, and distant from Hippo thirty furlongS,'' &c. The
same author asserts also (which we produced before), thatl
the breadth of the sea of Gennesaret was forty furlongs.
Therefore, with what reason do the maps place the whole sea
of Gennesaret- between Tiberias and Hippo? Read those
things in J osephus, look upon the maps, and judge.

II. The same Josephus saith of the same J ustus, Ἐμπί-
πρησι ὁ Ἰοῦστος τάς τε Γαδαρηνῶν καὶ Ἱππηνῶν κώμας· αἳ δὴ
μεθόριοι τῆς Τιβεριάδος, καὶ τῆς τῶν Σκυθοπολιτῶν γῆς ε’τύγ-
χανον κείμεναι. “ Justusm burnt the towns of those of Gadara
and Hippo. And the towns bordering upon Tiberias, and
the land of the Scytliopolitans, were laid waste.'' Note, how
the towns of those os Gadara and Hippo are called μεθόριοι,
“towns bordei-ing upon Tiberias ;'' which certainly cannot
