Gibon, the same with tlte Fountain of Siloam.

Ι. ΙΝ 1 Kings i. 33, 38, that which 18, 111 1110 Hebrew,
.“Bring ye Solonion to Gihon: and they brought him to
Grihon;” is rendered by the Ohaldee, “Bring ye him to
Siloam: and they brought him to Siloa1n.'' WVhere Kimchi
thus; “ Grihon is Siloam, and it is called by a double name.
And David commanded, that they should anoint Solomon at
Gihon for a good omen, to wit, that, as the waters of the foun-

Jerusalem writersf3 “ They do not anoint the king, but at a
fountain ; as it is said, ‘ Bring Solomon to Grihon.' '²

of David, Isa. viii. 6. “Forasmuch as this people refuseth
the waters of Siloah that go softly,'' &c. Where the
Ghaldee paraphrast thus; “Because this people 310 weary
of 1110 1101180 of David, which deals gently with them, as the
waters os Siloam slide away gently.'' And R. Solomon3
“Siloam 18 3 fountain, whose name is Gihon and Siloam.''

J osephus‚ speaking of that deep valley which runs between
Sion and Acra, saithg, καθήκει μέχρι Σιλωὰμ, “it 18 extended
to Siloam; for so we call the sweet and large fountain.''
But now the mounts Sion and Acra, and likewise the valley
that cut between 1110111, did run out from east 10 west. And
1110 same author, in the 831110 place, speaking of the compass
of the outermost wall, saith these things among others, καὶ
