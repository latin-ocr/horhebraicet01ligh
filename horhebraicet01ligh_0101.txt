Scopo. 9]

Therefore, some part of Olivet was called Bethany from
the palm-trees3 there was a town also, called of the same
name, over-against it. The town was fifteen furlongs distant
from Jerusalem. And the coast of that name went on, till
it reached the distance of a sabbath-day's journey only from
the city.

GH A P. XLII (1]
ΞἛἾΞ. Σκοπός. Scopo.

ΙΝ that manner as mount Olivet lay over-againstbthe city
on the east, the valley of Kedron running between,—so, on
the north, behind a valley somewhat broader, stretched out
from Sion northward, the land swelled into a hill, at the place
which from thence was called Zophim3 because thence there
was a prospect on all sides, but especially towards the city.

Concerning it Josephusr thus: “ Caesar, when he had
received a legion by night from Ammaus, the day aster
moving his tents thence, Ἐπὶ τὸυ Σκοπὸν καλούμενοι) πρόσεισιν·
”Ενθευ ἥ τε πόλις ἤδη κατεφαίνετο, καὶ τὸ τοῦ ναοῦ μέγεθος ἔκλαμ-
προν, ἄπο. He entered into Scopo so called. VVhere the city
appeared, and the greatness of the Temple shining out: as
that plain tract of land, touching upon the north coast of the
city, is truly called Scopas, The Viewer.''

Hence those canons and cautions : “ He S that pisseth, let
him turn his face to the north ε he that easeth nature, to the
south. R. J osi Ben R. Bon saith, The tradition is, From
Zophim and within :”—that is, if this be done by any one
from Zophim inwards, when he is now within the prospect
of the city3 when he pisseth‚ let him turn his face to the
north, that he do not expose his modest parts before the
Temple : when he easeth nature, let him turn his face to the
south, that he expose not his buttocks before it.

“ If t any one, being gone out of J erusalem. shall remember,
that holy flesh is in his hand, if he be now gone beyond
Zophim, let him burn it in the place where he is.'' (For it
is polluted by being carried out of the walls of Jerusalem.)
“ But if he be not beyond Zophim, let him go back, and burn
