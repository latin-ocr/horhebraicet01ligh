is, by Gamaliel, called ⁶ Judas of Galilee,' Acts v. 37,—who
yet, by Josephus, is called Γαυλανίτης ἀνὴρ, ἐκ πόλεως ὄνομα
Γαμάλα, “ Α k Gaulonite of the city of Gan1ala.” Now it is
well enough known that Gaulona and Gamala were beyond
Jordan.

Π. Ι suppose Perea, properly so called, to have gone also
under the name of Galilee, for these reasons:

1. The whole land of Oanaan‚ both that beyond and that
on this side Jordan, was under the jurisdiction of Herod the
Great. So that divide this whole country into four tetrar-
chies, the first J udea 3 the second Samaria; both which were
under the government of Pilate; the third, Iturea and Tra-
chonitis¹ under Philip; the fourth will be Galilee on this
side, and Perea beyond Jordan. Whereas, therefore, St. Luke,
in the division of the tetrarchies, names only Galilee, as that
which belonged to Herod, it is manifest he includes Perea
under that of Galilee, and speaks of it as a known and com-
monly-received thing.

2. In Luke xvii. 11, it is said of Jesus, that “ as he went
to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and
Galilee.'’ One would have thought it had been proper to
have said, “through the midst of G-alilee and Samaria.”
For when he went from Jerusalem to his own country, he
then passed through Samaria, and so into Galilee ; but going
from home to Jerusalem, he in his passage went through Ga-
lilee, and then through Samaria: but now it is very certain,
that in that journey he did pass through Perea, having first
gone through the Samaritan country. Whonce it is very
probable that Perea is called, by our evangelist in this place,
Galilee3 in the very same manner as he had also included it
in the mention of Galilee, Luke iii. 1.

3. In that tragical feast, wherein the last mess was the
head of John Baptist, those who¹ then were treated by He-
rod are called the ‘¹ great estates of Galilce‚’' Mark vi. 21.
Now, that supper was kept in the palace Herodium, which
was in the very extreme parts of Perea towards the south;
and, therefore, surely those “ great estates of Galilee,'' that
were with him, must be no other than the great estates of
Perea.
