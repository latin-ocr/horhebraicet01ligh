Castoms of the Galileans. 169

money, not of reputation,'' &cn

“ Thef wise men say, In Judea they did servile works on
the Passover-eves, until noon; in Galssee, not at all.”

ι :127er For the Galileans know not the Trumah of the
Temple-chamber.” The sense of the tradition is this, When
any one pronounced a vow in general ἐεηίῃεΓ-ἷοῐἱ example,
saying thus, ‘ Let this be to me as the Trmnah,’ not naming
what kind of Trumah‚—a Galilean, so speaking, was loosed
from his vow, because he, by reason of the distance of the
place (as the Gloss tells us), knew not the Trumah of the holy
treasury: but he that inhabited J udea, and spoke thus, was
bound by his vow.

And in the same text is added, ΠἻἾΠἾΞ ΞἾὮἻΠ ΟΠΞ
ΓἾἾΒδέ &Imm ΓἻῙἸἹῩΞ “ If any vows generally by curses, he
is loosed in Judea; he is bound in Galilee, because the Gali-
leans do not know the curses of the priestS.” where the
Gloss is this3 “ There were no priests among the Galileans:
therefore, when they cursed, they cursed to none but to God.''
And the Gemara of Jerusalem thus; “ Because they were
fastened to the curse of Achan, it is said, that they are
bound: but in J udea, because they are not fastened to the
curse of Achan‚ it is said that they are loosed.'’

“ Rabbi Judahh saith, In -Judea they made inquiry con-
cerning the bridegroom and bride three days before the wed-
ding: but in Galilee they did not so, In Judea they al-
lowed the bridegroom and bride private company one hour
before the wedding3 but they did not so in Galilee. It was a
custom in Judea, that the married persons should have two
ΓΞἮΨἹἮ friends, one of the family of the bridegroom, and
the other of the family of the bride: but it was not so in
Galilee. In «Judea those friends slept in the same place
where the bridegroom and bride slept: but in Galilec it was
not so‚’' &a
