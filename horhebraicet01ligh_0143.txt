Acon. Ptolemais. . 133

Ἀφροδίτης, qs Venus,—Then it is written in your laW‚ ‘ There
shall not cleave to thy hand any of the accursed thing 3³* He
answered, Ι must not answer you in the bath” (because you
must not speak of the law when you stand naked). “ WVhen
he came out therefore he said, I went not into her bounds‚
but she came into 1nine.” (The Gloss is, ‘The bath was
before she wasff) “And we say not, Let us make a fair
bath for Venus‚—but‚ Let us make a fair Venus for the
bath‚” &a

A story, done at Acon before R. Judah‚ is related, not
unworthy to be mentioned. “Rabbio came to a cert-ain
place, and saw the men of that place baking their dough in
uncleanness. then he inquired of them, Why they did so,
they answered, A certain scholar came hither, and taught us,
prtum ΓΝ [mum ⁵72 the waters 0⁵:522 are not of those
waters (that bring pollution). 'm inb ΨἻἾ ΞἛΞ, 'D ΝἾΠ
He spake of the wate-rs 2³33: (that is, of eglys),· but they
thought that he spake of :³³:722 ³72 the waters of the
marshes? These things we have the more willingly pro-
duced, that the reader may see that the letter 37 (Ain) was
no sound with these3 examples like to which we bring
elsewhere. Now hear the Glosser3 “ Rabbi saw this (saith
he) in Acon, in which is Israelitic land and heathen land:—
*now he saw them standing within the limits of Israelitis:
land, and baking their dough in unoleanness, and wondered,
until they told him, A certain scholar came hither‚‘' Sco.

Τ ἶὲᾭέἒέ, Caphar Acon, is very frequently mentioned by the
a mu is s.

‘⁶ A cityp which produceth fifteen hundred footmen, as
ἹΞὩ ab: Caphar Aeon, if nine dead persons be carried out
thence in three days successively, behold! it is the plague:
but if in one day, or in four days, then it is not the plague.
And a city which produceth five hundred foot, as 'away ab:
Caphar Amika,'' &o

Hence q are the names of some Acon Rabbins; zm,

“ R. Tanchumr‚ the son of R. Chaia of Caphar Acon.”
