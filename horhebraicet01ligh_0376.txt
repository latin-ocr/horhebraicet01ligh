yet they might properly enough be said to be in the middle

I'r is an even lay, whether the Targumist on this place deal
more eunningly or more obseurely. The passage is about
the king’s gardens : and he, “ I planted me all trees of spice,

the demens brouylct me out of India :¹³ and then goes on,

<md the bound of it was from the wall that is m Jerusalem,

of the fountain repaired Shallum, and the wall of the pool

otherwise, was at some distanee from the king's pool, Neh.
ii. 14 : ancl by the wall of the city, that ran between the gate
and the pool, there was a rivulet, drawn from the fountain
into that pool.

The words of tho Targumist, therefore, are to be so ren-
dered as that the king's gardens may not be said to extend
themselves to the bank of the waters of Siloam 3 but. that the
wall of Jerusalem ran along by the bank of those waters, and
the garden to the first part ofc that wall. So that he does
