But long before that, viz. in the days of the kings of Israel, it
was called the Grove of Libanus.”

Where at length shall we find this sture-a} Had Philip any
part of his tetrarehy within Cyrrhestica, or Chalcis bf Syria?
And yet, if you believe either Pliny or Strabo, there were the
Itureans. I suspect there is something couched in the ety-
mology of the word, that may as much puzzle as the situation
of the place.

lf Bacar, as it is described by Tyrius, be indeed Iturea‚ it
may be derived from ἾἸΠἾῺ Hittur, which signifies 'commu
or from 'l'l'ffi'ya which denotes crowm'7257, especially when the

Indeed, if I could believe that Iturea were the same with

from those on the south, viZ. the Horites in Edom. Now
that these countries‚ of which we are treating‚ were peculiarly
noted for caves and dens3 and they not only numerous, but
some very strange and wonderful, Strabo, Josephus, Tyrius,
and others, do abundantly testify.

are some cragged hills, famous for large and deep caves3 one
of which was capable of receiving four thousand men in it?
But that was a prodigions cave of Zedekiah’s, wherever it
was, that was eighteen miles' space 3 at least, if those things
be true which are related concerning it ¹¹.
