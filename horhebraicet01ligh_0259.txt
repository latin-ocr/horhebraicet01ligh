Midland Phoenicia. 249

reckoned all one, Iam in doubt. I had rather divide Phoe-
nicia into three parts, namely‚ into Phoenicia on the sea
coast, Midland Phoenicia, and Syrophoenicia. And the rea-
son is, because Ι ask whether all Midland Phoenicia might
be called Syrophoenicia: and I ask, moreover, whether all
Syrophoenieia were to be reckoned within the bounds of Tyre
and Sidon? Certainly N icetas Ohoniates mentions the Syro-
phoenician cities as far as Antioch. For he, in the story of
John Comenius, hath these words, ''Eyzw προσβαλεῖν ταῖς παρὰ
τὴν Ἀντιόχου ἱδρυμέναις, καὶ Ἀγαρηυῶυ κατεχομέναις Συροφοι-
νίο-σαις πόλεσι· “ He resolved to set upon the Syrophoenician
cities bordering upon Antioch, which were possessed by the
Agarenes.'’ But now, will you reckon those cities as far as
Antioch to be within the jurisdiction of Tyre and Sidon?
But certainly there is nothing hinders but you may reckon
those to be so which Ptolemy esteerns to belong to Midland
Phceniciag only the scruple is about Caesarea of Paneas,
which is Caesarea Philippi: and that, we shall see, belonged
to the Decapolitan cities, and may be determined, without
any absurdity, to be within that jurisdiction of Tyre and
Sidon, as also Leshem of old, which was the same city, -Judges
xviii. 28.

Let one clause of the Tahnudists be added3 and then those
things which arc spoken may be reduced into a narrowcr com-
pass. They, reducing the bounds of the land under the second
Temple, fix for a bound ΓἾΒῬ 372 U½9U³TT ΠΝῙὮἾὩ ΝΒἾἎΞἾΠ
“ Tarnegola m the Upper, which is above Caesarea.'' Observe,
that Caesarea is a city of Midland Phoenicia, according to
Ptole1ny; and yet Tarnegola, which bends more northward,
is within the land of Israel, according to the Hebrews.

of Tyre and Sidon‚” and yet be within the limits of the land
of Israel. We must therefore suppose, and that not with-
out reason, that he, when he healed the possessed maid, was,

formerly was called Ghabul, in the Seventy called ‘'Optov‚
