Of the warm baths of Tiberias the Talmudists speak much.
Let these few things be collected out of them :—

“ R. J osuaz Ben Levi being sick, wasked sometime in the
‘marm batks of Tiberias, (ΝἾἾᾞΔἻ ΓΒἿὩἾἾ ῙΠΠΞ ’nom lean-
ing on the shoulders of R. Chajia Bar Ba?

“ Threea warm baths remained from the waters of the de-
luge.'’' Ι. *rm-1 7737'1372 tlte whirlpool of Gadara .· that pool
of Gadara, it may be, is that, which being drank of, DS
Strabo b relateS, cattle lose their hair, horns, and hoofs. II.

z ΝἿὊῖΔ ”DI-U ΠἾΞΠΞ ”D 1371? ὟἾἾὟΠ “ Theyc allowed them
the waters of Meara and the warm baths of Tiberias.’'

So also J osephusd: “ John (of Giscala) writ to me, praying
Χρήσασθαι τοῖς ἐν Τιβεριάδι θερμοῖς ὕδασι, ‘ that I would permit
him the use of the warm baths which are at Tiberias.'''

And so Pliny before: “ Tiberiade, aquis calidis salubri ;”
“ Tiberias, healthful for its warm waters.”
