sacrifices without the Temple of God, and instituted rites out
of their own heart. In that Temple, Manasseh‚ the son-in-
law of Sanballat‚ the son of Joshua, the son of Jozedek the
high-priest‚ performed the priest's office. And at that time
Zadok and Baithus, the scholars of Antigonus, did flourish;
and hence was the beginning of the schism; —namely‚
when, in the days of Antigonus, many went back to mount
Gerizim.''

Thaty Temple flourished about two hundred years, andz
it perished by the sword and fire of Hyrcanus: but the Sa-
maritan superstition perished not, but lasted for many ages ;
as odious to the Jews as heathenism, John iv. 9. Yet they
confess that ΠἾἾΠὮ ΒἾἾὈ Vn& the a laad of the Sa-
mari-tans was clean, and their fountains clean, and their
dwellings clean, and their paths clean.'' But much dispute is
made about their victuals, in the place noted in the margin.
“ R. Jacob Bar Acha in the name of R. Lazar saith, ‘ The
victuals of the Cutheans are lawful,' which is to be understood

Sorika. Why the wine of En Cushith ἓ Because of Caphar
Salama. But they said afterward, If it be open, it is every
where forbidden ς if it be covered, it is lawful.’' And a story
concerning R. Simeon Ben Lazar follows3 who came into a
certain city of the Samaritam, and a certain Samaritan scribe
came to him3 from whom when he asked something to drink‚
and it was set before him, ³⁴79 ΠἾὩΝ “ he doubted about
it,··’ &c. And other things to that purpose are read not
much after: ᾪἯἾὩΟ ¹722 ΝἿὩΠ ΠΞΠΨἾΝ &³7 No wine
was found ia alc Samaria, on a certain eve of the sabbath,
but, in the end of the sabbath, there was abundance3 for the
Syrians had brought it, and the Samaritans received it of
them,'' &a
