Trachonitis. 299

Gaulonitis too; for we meet with that distinction also in
Josephusv. To give, therefore, all these countries at this
time their proper bounds and limits, if it does not exceecl all
human skill and wit, Ι am sure it doth mine.

Sop that all we ean do in this matter, is only to propound
a few things of these places thus divided‚ as far as conjec-
ture may carry us, which we submit fairly to the fair and
candid judgment of the reader. Let us, therefore, begin with
Trachonitis.

S E c T, [V .-—- Trachonitis.

Ancon, mentioned Deut. iii. 14, is, by the Targumists,
called &ml-510 and ΝΠὉἾΤΔ Τνασῖιοηα. And so J onath.

from dragous. Those hidden passages and windings under-
ground‚ with which this country abounds, are called dragous.
Indeed, almost all the people of this country have their dwell-
ings in dens and caves3 and in these kind of dragons‚’'

Other things might be offered as to the signification of
the word: but we are looking after the situation of the
place, not the etymology of the name. And the first thing
to be inquired into, as to its situation, is, whether it extended
in longitude from the south to the north, or from the west
to the east. The reason of our inquiry is, partly upon the
account of Auranitis, which we are to speak of presently,
and partly those words in Josephus‚ ὡρίζετο δὲ αὐτὴ [Βαταναία]
τῇ Τραχωνίτιδι· “Bataneas was bounded with T1·achonitis.“'
How so‘? Either that Batanea lay between Perea and Tra-
chonitis, extending itself from the west towards the east, or
between Trachonitis and Galilee‚ strictly so called, extend-
ing itself in length from the south towards the north: which
