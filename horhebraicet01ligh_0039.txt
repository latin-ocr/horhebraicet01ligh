Mountainous country of Judea. 99

tainous country is not, therefore, called ΞἿἾῙ] Ἶὲᾛβ “ The
mountainous desert,'’ because it was void of cities and towns,
but because it was a more barren and rough country.

&nb-tamnen &humus aa. “Thea Royal Mountain was
laid waste by reason of a cock and a hen. It was the custom,
when they brought forth the bridegroom and the bride, to
lead before them a cock and a hen: as if they should say,
Increase and multiply, as they. On a certain day a regiinent
of Romans passed by, and wrested the cock and the hen from
them : these, therefore, rose up against them, and beat- them.
Away, therefore, they go to Gaesar, and told him, The Jews
rebel against thee, διο. R. Asai saith, Three hundred thou-
sand drew sword, and went up to the Royal Mountain, and
there slew for three days and three nights,'’ διο.

Rabbi Asai saith, “J anneus the king had sixty myriads of
cities in the Royal Mountain: and in each the number was
equal to them, that went out of Egypt,—excepting three
cities, in which that number was doubted. And these were,
I. mm ἾΞΣ, Caphar Biffi' (that is, the I ll Town) ,· ‘⁶ therefore
called so ΝῘΤῘ, &c because it afforded not a house of hospi-
tality. II. ΕἾἿιῬΠἿζ) ἾΞΞ, a town, that had its name from a
certain herb, because by that herb they were nourished.
III. &⁸537 ἾΞΣ, {lc-c town of males ‚· so called, saith R. J ocha-
nan, because their wives first brought forth males, and then
females, and so left off.''

This story is recited by the Jerusalem Talmudists, who
say, &³527 ἿΞΞῙ) is so called, because, unless the women
departed thence somewhere else, they could not bring forth
male children.

“ But (saith Ulla) I saw that place, and it is not able to
contain even sixty myriads of nests. Therefore, said a certain
sectary of R. Chaninah, Ye lie, ye lie. To whom he replied
That land is called *233 ῩἾΝ ‘ the land of a Kid :² but now
³22 ‘a kid’ bath a skin, that does notc contain his flesh: so
the land of Israel, while it is inhabited, is spacious; but,
when uninhabited, more contracted.'’
