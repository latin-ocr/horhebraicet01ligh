Galilee. 1 25

when Alexander saw Simeon the Just lighting down out of
his chariot he worshipped him‚'' &a

Do you think that the high-priest, clothed in his priestly
garments, and the Jews, went through all Samaria almost in
such solemn processioni Josephus, relating this story, only
the name of Jaddua changed, saith, this meeting was εἰςι
τόπον τινὰ Σαφᾶ λεγόμενον. Τὸ δὲ ὄνομα τοῦτο μεταφερόμενον εἰς
τὴν Ἑλληνικὴν γλῶτταν σκοπὴν σημαίνει, Sto. “at a certain
place called Sapha. But this name, being changed into the
Greek language, signifies, A watch-tower. For the buildings
of Jerusalem and the Temple might from thence be seen.'' Of
which place he and we treat elsewhere under the name of
Σκοπὸς, Scopas, and ΕἛἾΕ, Tzoplzz‘m.

CHAP. LIX.

Galilee. ³7³2.

“ ΤΗΕΒΕυ is Galilee the upper, and Galilee the nether‚ and
the valley. From Caphar Hananiah‚ and upwards,-what-
soever land produceth not sycamines, is Galilee the upper:
but from Caphar Hananiah, and below, whatsoever produceth
sycamines, is Galilee the nether‚ There is also the coast of
Tiberias, and the valley.’'

ΔύοΧ δ’ οὔσας τὰς Γαλιλαίας, τήν τε ἄνω, καὶ τὴν κάτω προσα-
γορευομένην, &c “ Phoenice and Syria compass both (Jralilees,
both the upper and the nether‚ so called. Ptolemais and
Carmel bound the country westward.''

That which is said before of the sycamines, recalls to mind
the city Sycaminon, of which Pliny speaks: ‘⁸ We must go
back (saith hey) to the coast, and to Phoenice. There
was the town Crocodilon: it is a river. The remembrance
of cities. Dorum, Sycaminum, the promontory Carmel‚’' &a

Andz Josephusat ”Επλευσε, καὶ καταχθεὶς εἷς τὴν λεγομένην
Συκάμινον, 836. “ Η6 set san, and, being brought to the city
called Sycaminum‚ there he lauded his forces.”
