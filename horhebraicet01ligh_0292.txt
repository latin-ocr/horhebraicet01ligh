eneeu from those countries inhabited by the sons of canaan,
of whom we have spoke: partly X, because 06116611 1116 father
probably fixed his seat there himself ; and thence both that
country was called Canaan, and the whole land moreover
called “ The land of Canaan.”

RneKON the 80118 of Ganaan in Gen. x3 and where do you
find the Pel-izzites? And yet, a matter 10 be wondered at,
they are always :numbered in that black catalogue of the
seven nations to be cut off.

Ι know it is supposed by some that they are called Periz-
εἰὶσε, 68 much as 10 say villa-qam, because they dwelt in vil-
Zayes, and small towns unfortified: which, indeed, varies not
much from the derivation of the word: but certainly it is
needless, when all the Canaanitish families are reckoned up,
which possessed the whole land, to add the villayers over
and above, who. were sufficiently included in the aforesaid
reckoning.

But that which we know was done by the Israelites‚ we
justly suppose was done by the 0606601168 618ος namely, that
some families of the Canaanite stock were denominated, not
from the very immediate son of Oanaan, from whom they
derived their original, but from some famous and memorable
man of that stock. Nor do we say this upon conjecture
alone, but by very many examples among the Israelites; and,
indeed, among 011161· 11611008, and this in that very nation of
which we are speaking. In Gen. xxxvi, Zibeon was the son
of Seir, ver. 203 and the whole 061100 and land was called,
“ The nation and land of the sons of Seir.'' But now 11161
11161 Seir was of the 0606611116 pedigree, appears sufficiently
hence, that· his son Zibeon was called a Hivite, ver. 2. After
the same manner therefore as the Seirites, who were of
Canaanite blood, were 80 named, I make no doubt the Periz-
zites were named from one Perez, a man of great name in

some Canaanite stock.
