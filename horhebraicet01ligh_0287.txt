that, on the contrary, he blesseth the conqueror, and yields
him the choicest fruits of his land, bread and wine, not only
for refreshment to him and his soldiers, but also, perhaps, for
a sign rather of resignation, and investing him with the he-
reditary right of it, whom God, by so signal a mark, had
shown to be the heir. Upon very good reason, therefore,
Abraham is called Hebrew, to point as it were with the
finger, that God would derive the inheritance of that land
from the family of Elam to the family of Heber, from the
first-born to him that was born after; which was also done
afterward with Reuben and Joseph.

II. Iti neither ought, nor indeed can be passed over with-
out observation, that the country of Pentapolis, and the
countries adjacent, were subjects and tributaries to Chedor-
laomer king of Elam. What l was there any part of the land
of Oanaan subject to the king os the Persians, when so many
kings and countries lay between it and Persia? No idle
scruple and difficulty, I assure you ; nor, as far as I can see,
any otherwise to be resolved, than that Elam, the first-born
of Sem, or lNsIelchisedek, by his birthright, was heir of that
land, which his father Sem possessed by divine right and
patent; and the sons of Elam also held after him, and his
grandsonS, unto Chedorlaomer. For when it is said that
those cities and countries had served Ohedorlaomer twelve
years, the times of his reign seem rather to be reckoned than
the years of the reign of the Elamites. Not that those nations
were subject to the sceptre of the Elamites twelve years only,
but that- that year was only the twelfth 'of Chedorlaomer.
But now God translates the inheritance to the family of
Heber, called Hebrew before, but now more particularly,
and more honourably, since, of all the families of Sem, that
was now most eminent. ‘³237 Heber denotes Hebrews, as '‘lWJN
