A

cHOROGRAPHIOAL DECAD,

&c &0ss

WHEN this our evangelist, whom we have undertaken to
handle, makes mention of some places in the land of Canaan,
whose situation is somewhat obscure and more remote from
vulgar knowledge3 Ι might seem to be wanting to my task,
if I should pass them over unsaluted, and not clear them, as
much as lies in me, with some illustration: which I thought
very convenient to do here in the very entrance; partly.
lest„ by the thrusting-in of these discourses into the body of
this comment, whatsoever it be, the order of it might be too
much broken; and partly, because Ι would do the same here
that I did before my animadversions on St. Matthew.

The places which here are handled are these :

I. Idumea, Mark iii. 8.

II. Ἕρημος, ‘ The wilderness ς’ chap. i. 4.

III. Γαζοφυλάκιου, ‘ The treasury ς’ chap. xii. 41·

IV. ‘H κώμη ἡ κατέναντι, ‘ The village over-against ς’ chap.
xi. 2.

V. Dal1nanutha; chap. viii. 10.

VI. Ὅρια Τύρου, καὶ Σιδῶνος· ‘ The bordel's Of Tyre and
Sidon ς’ chap. vii. 24.

VII. The coasts of Decapolis3 chap. vii. 3¹· And to
complete the Deoad‚ are added,

VIII. Some measurings.

IX. Some places here and there noted.

X. Concerning some inhabitants of tho land.

That I have enlarged upon some places, besides those in

a Enylish folio edition, vol. ii. p. 289.—Le11s1len's edition. vol. ii. p. 397.
