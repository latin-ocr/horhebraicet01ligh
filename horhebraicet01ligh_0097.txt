Mount of 0256.

“''Oposy τὸ προσαγορευόμενον Ἐλαιῶν, ὃ καὶ τῆς πόλεως ἀντι-
κρὺς κείμενον, ἀπέχει στάδια πέντε. The mount called the
mount of olives, lying over against the city, is distant five
furlongs.’' But Luke saith, Acts i. 12, “ Then they returned
from the mount called Olivet, ὅ ἐστιν ἐγγὺς Ἶερουσαλὴμ σαβ-
βάτου ἕχου ὁδόν· “ which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's
journey.” But now a sabbath-day's journeyZ contained eight
furlongs, or a whole mile. Neither yet, for all this, (loth
Luke fight against Josephus. For this last measures the
space to the first foundation of Olivet; the other, to that
place of Olivet, where our Saviour ascendcd. The first foot
of the mount was distant five furlongs from the city3 but
Christ, being about to ascend, went up the mountain three
furlongs farther.

The mount had its name from the Oliva-trees, however
other trees grew in it3 and that, because the number of
these perhaps was greater, and the fruit better. Among
other trees, two cedars are mentioned, or rather two mon-
sters of cedars. ‘⁶ Two 2¹ cedars (they say) were in the mount
of Olivet, under one of which were four shops, where all
things needful for purifications were sold: out of the other,
they fetched, every month, forty seahs” (certain nicasures)
“ of pigeons, whence all the women to be purified were sup-
plied.''

It is a dream like that story, that, beneath this mountain,
all the dead are to be raised. “When the dead shall live
again (say theyb), mount Olivet is to be rent in two, and all
the dead of Israel shall come out thence; yea, those right-
eous persons, who died in captivity, shall be rolled under
the earth, and shall come forth under the mount of Olivet.”

Thero was a place in the mount, directly opposite against
