itself held two-and-twenty furlongs :⁵³ nor can it well be taken

rather of the extent of the bounds of it that way, which he
went.

Εἶθ’ ἡ Πτολεμαΐς ἐστι μεγάλη πόλις, ἣν Ἀκὴν ὠνόμαζον, διο.
“ Moreover, from Tyre” (southward) “is Ptolemais, formerly
called Ace. And between Ace and Tyre, is a shore heaped
with sands fit to make glass.''

Μετὰ δὲ τὴν Ἀκὴν Στράτωνος πύργος, &Q ‘⁶ Beyond Ace is
the tower of Strato. The mountain Carmel lies between: and
the names of some small cities, and nothing more. The cities
of Sycamines, of Herdsmen, of Crocodiles, and others. And
going thence, is a certain great wood.”

Casius towards Pelusium, the distance is a thousand fur-
longs, and a little more. And three hundred more to Pe-
lusiun1.”

Here we must stop, and see how these two authors do
agree. For, according to Strabds account, one thousand
three hundred furlongs, and a little more, run out from Pelu-
sium to J oppa: that is, one hundred and sixty three miles, or
thereabouts: but according to Pliny”s, at first sight, more by
