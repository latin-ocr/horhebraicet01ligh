swim out of Palestine into Babylon. By the same art they
bring J onah in the belly of the whale, out of the Phoenician
sea, into the Red sead.

That, indeed, is somewhat hard, yet· not to be doubted of,
what is said, ρ Chron. viii. 18, concerning Hiram sending
ships to Solomon into the Red sea. What! ships to come
from 'Pyre into the Red sea? Which way sailed they? It is
answered‚ He sent such Tyrian ships, which had much and
long traded before in the Red sea, to accompany Solomon’s
fleet. To this belongs that, that it is said there likewise (and
in 1 Kings ix. 27), that· “he sent seamen, that had knowledge
of the sea 3³⁹ that is, knowledge of that sea: and they proba-

‘⁶ Kirmion is a river in the wayg to Damascus, and is the
same with Amanah. Pigah is Pharphar. And Jarmoch is
also a river in the way 130 Damascus.” And the Talmudistsh:
“ Τ110 waters of Kirmion and Pigah are not fiff' (to sprinkle
the unclean), “because they are muddy waters. The waters
also of Jordan, and the waters of J armoch, are not fit, because
they are mixed waters :⁷'——that is, as the Gloss speaks, mixed
with the waters of other rivers, which they receive within
themselves.

Toi the seven scas, concerning which we have spoken,
those things which are said by Midras Tillimk‚ do refer: “ I
have created seven scas, saith the Lord, but out of them all
1 have chosen none, but the sea of Gennesaret.’'—And of the
river ofAinanah, of which the Aruch speaks, mention is made
in the Targum upon Cant. iv. 8 ε “ They that dwell upon the
river Amanah, shall offer thee a gistss’ &c
