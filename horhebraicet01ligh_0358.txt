Asphaltites, fronts it on the west, and Machaerus situated on
the north, fronts it on the south? otherwise, you would
remove Machaerus a great way from its proper situation.

We meet with it in the Talmudists under the name of
Macvar.

“ The mountainous country of Perea was the hill Macvar
and Gedor.” The Jerusalem Targumn, and J onathan upon
Numb. xxxii, 35, instead of “ Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer,''
have ἾἾἾΣΌ Π“”Ἶ imma &nuum ,ΠἿ “ Maclelta of Shophan
and Mamm-:⁹⁹ to which Jonathan adds NUD'U ἾἸὉὩ
“ Macvar of Garamatha.'’

It is obvious enough how they came to render ΠἾἾζοὩ
Αίνοτῖι by &15373722 Maolecta, (as also Onkelos hath done);
viz. because they translated the Hebrew word, which denotes
a croton, by the Ohaldee word, which is of the same signifi-
cation. But why Jaazer by ἾἸὈὩ Maevar ‚9 Onkelos upon
the third verse of the same chapter, renders ‘ Jaazer' and
‘ Nimrah' by ΓἾῺΠ ΠἾΓῙ ΓἾὮὈ, which I should translate,
“ the Atratz' or 'deniyrati of the house of Nimrin.'' And Pto-
lemy comments thus in Arabia Petraea: Διατείυει δὲ ἐν τῇ
χώρᾳ τὰ καλούμενα μέλανα ὅρη, &Q ‘⁶ There are all along
that country certain mountains called the Black Mountains‚
namely, from the bay which is near Pharan, to Judea.'⁷ But
whether ἾἾἾΣΚ) Macvar hath any relation with blackness from 0
ἾἾΞ a dish or furnace, I leave it to others to inquire.

So that we see Herodium and Machaerus are situated on
the outermost coast of Perea towards the south, or the land
of Moab, near the shore of Asphaltites, or the Dead sea.

The nature of the place we have described by Josephus,
Ῥέουσι δὲ καὶ θερμῶν ὑδάτων πηγαὶ κατὰ τὸν τόπον Ρ, 830.
‘⁶ There spring out, near this place, certain fountains of hot
waters, of a 'very different taste, some bitter some sweet:
there arc also many springs of cold waters,” Sec. Compare
the bitter waters with tho waters of Nimrin, lsa. xv. 6, and
the other with those of Dimon, ver. 9 ; where, query whether
Dimon be not the same with Dibon [Beth (Ξ) and Mem (D)
being alternately usc(l]; that by that pronunciation it might
