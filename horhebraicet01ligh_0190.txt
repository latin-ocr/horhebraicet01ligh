J ulias-Bethsaida was not seated in Galilee, as it is in the
inaps, but beyond the sea of Galilee in Perea. This we say
upon the credit of Josephus: “Philip (saith he f) built Cae-
sarea in Paneas, καὶ ἐν τῇ κάτω Γαυλανιτικῇ Ἰουλιάδα [mark
that]: and J ulias [which before-time was Bethsaida] in Ne-
ther Gaulonitis.” But now, there is nobody but knows that
Gaulonitis was in Perea. This certainly is that J ulias which
Plinyg placeth eastward of the lake of Gennesaret (for the
other J ulias was scarcely near the sea at all); and that Julias
of which J osephus speakS, when he saith h, ‘⁶ that a certain
mountainous country beyond Jordan runs out from J ulias to
Somorrha.'’

Gamala. Chorazin.

THESE things determine the situation of Gamala 2—1. It
was εἰ)ἱ κάτω Γαυλανᾷ, “in lower Gaulon,” in which, as we
have seen, Bethsaida was, 2. It was ὑπὲρ τὴν λίμνην [Γεννη-
σαρίτιδα]· “ upon the lake [of Gennesaret].” 3. It was Ta-
ριχαιῶν ἀντικρὺς, “over-against Taricliee.” Compare the
maps, whether in their placing of it they agree with these
passages. Herek was Judas born, commonly called ‘Grau-
lanites} and as commonly also, the ‘ Galilean.’ So Peter and
Andrew and Philip were Gaulanites3 of Bethsaida, John i.
44 3 and yet they were called ‘ Galileans?

While we are speaking of Bethsaida, Chorazin comes into
our mind, which is joined with it, in the words of Christ,
Matt. xi. 21, as partaking with it in his miracles, and being
guilty of equal ingratitude. If you scel( for the situation of
this place, where will you find it‘? Some maps place it on
this side Jordan, and others beyond Jordan: but on what
authority do both depend? lt is mere conjecture, unless I
am deceived. Let me also conjecture.

The¹ word ΓΚΠἾἾΠ ΟΙιοναεΜη, denotos woocly plac-68, both

in the Holy Bible and in the Rabbinical writings. Hence ,

wc suppose the Chorazin that is now before us is called,
