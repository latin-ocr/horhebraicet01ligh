Jonatlcan upon Numb. xxxiv. 8. 381

strange thing the Targumist should be no better read in cho-
rography‚ than to mistake the reading of this word ΠὩΠ in
this place. For it is plain he read nnn mmmmm, or the
‘⁶ warm baths of Tiberias, ” when it is really Hamath, or
‘ Antioch.' He is a blind geographer that brings down the
borders of the land of Israel to Tiberias, unless he means
something beyond our capacity to apprehend.

IV. ἾἹἾτΔΞζ ΓἻΠ Ῑῃ From tlte two sidess] It is plain here
also, that he took ΠἾἻΒ Zedad, appellatively for Ἳέζ α side.

V. way} *527 niz-1:³7 To Codcor Bar Zaamalc:] If he
doth not blunder, we do. We only take notice, that ΠὩὩΤ
Zaamah, ancl &au-030 Si·n690ra‚ do signify indiynatz‘on, and
advocate, perhaps in the same sense that *nmo and *555wa
are often used, in the Rabbinical writers, for accuser and
advocate .· but what it should signify in him, he must shew
himself an OEdipus'‚ or somebody else.

VI. ῦὊρἹἸἾἻ Divachenus :] I suspect this to be Greek, viz,
Διαυχένιος. By which is intimated some back of a mountain,
either lifting itself up, or stretching itself out. And this I
suspect the more by the Jerusalem version upon ver. 15 :

paup-11¹² sabi-i aim mppr-127 smum ,which 1 would
thus render, “ The borders shall be to the Διαυχέυιου of the

snowy mountain of Caesarea.” WVhere by Caesama, is to be
understood Caesarea Philippi; where indeed the bordei· of
the north partos the land did not end, but extended higher
and beyond, 'pan-‚7 με affirm& ἡ mz‘vw &Sum-³³7 “even
to upper Tarnegola, which is above Oaesarea;” i. e. πρὸς
αὐχένα to the neck of the mount Antilibanus.

The wlzitmzess [3:232] of Libanus gave it its name, both of
Libanus and the ‘ Mountain of snOW,' because its wln'teness
was occasioned by the snows upon it. [But by what deri-
vation ‘ Oyndus' should, in the Syrian language, denote
whiteness, I confess it is beyond my skill in that tongue
to knoxv3 which yet Solinus affirmsn it doth; “ thatever is
white (saith he), the Syrians, in their language, called Cydnus3
whence the name given to the river Cydnus.''] And it is
worthy noting, that Lebzmon, in the Hebrew text, is often, by
the Greek interpreters, rendered Ἀντιλίβανος, ‘ Antilibanus?

So Dent. xi. 24, Josh. i.4‚ &c.; and sometimes by the Tal-

mudists, &5243 Bala.
