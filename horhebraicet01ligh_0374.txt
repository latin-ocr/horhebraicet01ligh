’Ένθεν τε πάλιν ἐκκλίνον πρὸς ἀνατολὴν ἐπὶ τὴν Σολομῶνος
κολυμβήθραν· “ T lae wall eglaim inclined eastweard, even to
Solomon's fislc-poml, and going on to the place called Ophel,
it came over-against the eastern poroh of the Temple.'' From
whence we may gather that Solomon’s fish-pool was within,
hard by the east wall of the city, and on this side the place
they called ophel: which does so well agree with the situa-
tion of Bethesda within the sheep-gate, that it seems to me
beyond all doubt or question, that Solomon's pool and the
pool of Bethesda were one and the same.

SECT. III.— The pool Πζῖζῑ] Slzelahh, and the pool
17³sz Skiloak. ·

ΒΥ another stream the waters of Siloam are derived into
another pool‚ which is called the Lower Pool, Isa. xxii. 9,
and the King's Pool, Neh. ii. ¹43 near the west wall of Sion.

We have the mention of it also in Neh. iii. 15: Πέᾏῇ
ΤΙῘἯΞΓ] HL) Πῑῗῐῃζῖ the pool of Siloam by tlte kz‘ny's gyardcm.
XVhere we may observe that it is here written Ulpi? Skecalah,
different from 05³3& stamma, Isa. viii. 63 by a differenee
hardly visible in Bibles not pointed: indeed, sometimes over-
looked by myself, and so, as is evident‚ by others. For ΠῘἏΠ
is rendered in the very same sound with Shiloalesla, in the
Complutensian, Vulgar, English, and Freneh Bibles. And,
in St. John ix. 7, where there is mention of the pool Siloam,
some Commentators refer you to that text in N ehemiah.

T he Greek interpreters did, indeed, observe the differmme,
and thus render the words of Nehemiah, Κολυμβήθρας τῶν
κωδίων τῇ κουρξι τοῦ βασιλέως· “ The pool of skins by tho
king's wool b.’' Nor doth the Italian overlook it3 for that
renders it thus: “ La Piscina di Selao presso al orto ‹lel Re :”
“ The 1³*isl1-ponsl of Solae hard by the garden of the king.''

It is observable in the Greek version, that whereas they
render the word by τῇ κουρᾷ τοῦ βασιλέως, the kingy's wool,
or hair, they may seem to have read *532 (ι sleece of wool,

for Ῑᾎ (ι ῃανάεη. And whereas they translato Πιξὶζ] ΠέἾΞ
by κολυμβήθρα τῶν κωδίων, the pool of skins, they follow the
signification of the word as it is frequently used anlongst the
Talmudists.
