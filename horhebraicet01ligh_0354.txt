ἾὋΞὍ the ⁸ Maacliathites' are by thern called ῦἾἾΡἜΝ the
‘ Epikerites,⁷ Deut. iii. ¹43 Josh. xiii. ¹3- And this, probably,
from the place or country where the Maachathites of old
dwelt, which, in the time of the Targumists, was called
Ἐπίκαιρος, ἀπ’ ἀνατολῶν ποταμοῦ Ἰορδάνου, ‘⁴ Epicaerus on
the east of the river Jordan‚’' deg. 67. 31. 0³. VVhether in-
deed the situation doth fall out right, I shall not at present
discourse.

But the ‘ Kenite’ is not termed a ⁶ Salmean' from any place
or country where he dwelt. For the Kenites in the southern
part of J udea are called ‘ Salameans,' Judg. i. [16.] So also
Heber the Kenite in Gafflee, J udg. iv. [ι 1.] And there were
Kenites aniongst the Amalekites, 1 Sam. xv. [6] ; and there
were of the Kenites beyond Jordan, Gen. xv. [19]: whence
so called is not to 0111· purpose. It sufficeth, that they were
vulgarly known by the name of 7¹1&wa Salam03 which, how
near akin it is to Σαλεὶμ, Salim, let the unbiassed reader
judge. W ho knoweth‚ therefore, but the evangelist should
mean thus; “John was baptizing in AEnon, near the Sala-
mean, ‘ or Kenite ;'’' giving that name. to that people‚ which,
at that time, they were commonly called by? But supposing
this should be granted us, what Kenite should we understand
here? either those that were in the wilderness of J udah, or
those on the other side of the salt sea?

11Ἴ the ⁸ Essenc' might be called Πζκξζῑῖἳω Salonam, as well
as Kenite (and certainly he seems to have as much claim to
it, if the word denote perfimt'e'on, or austeritjs of life), then
I could more confidently place our Σαλεὶμ, Sabim, in the wil-
derness of ,Judah3 because there Ι find AEnon mentioned in
the Greek version, J osh. xv. 61, 62 : where the Hebrew hath
it thus: “ In the wilderness, Beth-araba, Middin, and Seca-
01111, and Nishban, and the city of Salt, and En-gedi, six
citieS:’' but the Greek, καὶ Βαδδαργεὶς, καὶ Θαραβαᾶμ, καὶ
Αἰνὼν, &c “ And Baclclarffl's, and Tlcarabaam, and “Phaon”

but why it should bs· so, is 111010 ‹lifficult to toll. 'Phis only
