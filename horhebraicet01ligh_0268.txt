also is unknown. There was a Gabara about Caesarea Phi-

And now let the reader judge whether these were some
of the Decapolitan cities. Whether they were or no, we
neither determine, nor are we much solicitous about it: that

which we chiefly urge is, that, by the places before men-

were indeed within the limits of the land of Israel, but in-
habited by Gentiles Jews indeed dwelt with them, but
fewer in number= inferior in power, and not so free both in
their possessions and privileges. And if you ask the reason
why they would dwell in such an inferiority with the heathens,
take this: “Theu Rabbins deliver. Let one always linin
the land of lsrael, though it be in a city the greatest part
of which are heathens. And let not a man dwell without
the land, yea, not in a city the greatest part of which are
Israelites. For he that lives in the land of Israel hath
God3 but he that lives without the land is as if he had not
God3 as it is said, ‘To give you the land of Canaan, that
God may bc with you‚”' &c. Would you have more reasons?
“ thosoeverx lives within the land of lsrael is absolved from
iniquity. And whosoever is buried within the land of Israel
is as if ho were buried under the altar.'’ Take one for all:
“They men of Israel are very wise; for the very climate
makes wise.'' Ο most wise Rabbinsl
