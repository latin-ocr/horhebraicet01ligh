“ R. Simeonr Ben J ochai, by reason of certain shambles
in the streets of Tiberim, was forced to purify that place.
And whosoever travelled by Magdala might hear the voice

“ A certain S old shepherd came, and said before Rabbi‚ ‘ I
remember the men of Magdala going up to Chammath‚ and
walking through all Ghammath” (on the sabbath), ‘⁶ and
coming as far as the outmost street, as far as the bridge.
Therefore Rabbi permitted the men of Magdala to go into
Chammath‚ and to go through all Chammath‚ and to proceed
as far as the farthermost street, as far as the bridge.’'
