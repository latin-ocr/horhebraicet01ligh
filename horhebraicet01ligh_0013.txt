THE PREFAOE.

AMONG all those, who have either published their own cho-
rographical tables of the land of Oanaan, or have corrected
others,—you can hardly find any, that have consult-ed with
the writers of the Talmud in this matter: whereas, certainly,
their consent is by no means in this case to be despised, if,
indeed, it be not rather especially to be regarded.

For, besides that they, above all other men, do most
curiously inquire of the affairs and of the places of that land,
——all the doctors of the Misna‚ and the Gemarists also of
Jerusalem, were inhabitants and dwellers there: and not a

and nature of the places in that land, and to trace them
out with an exact search and curiosity.

Let reason, therefore, determine, whether they, above all

for the correcting and polishing this, the means that the
Talmud affords, should, with any merit or equity, be only
refused? Why the Jewish chorography of the Jewish country
should not be admitted ’Ξ Certainly, it is unjust, out of pre-
judice, to reject⁷ or out of ignorance not to entertain, those
things, which either might yield us the profit of the choro-
graphy of that land, or stir up no unprofitable search into it.
If a man would engrave maps of Palestine, surely it is very
fit, that he‘should, together with others, consult those authors,
as being the nearest witnesses, inhabiters of the country, and
such as most studiously and most rcligiously describe it.
And though you esteem them not worthy of credit, because
