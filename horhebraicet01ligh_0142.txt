on the sea-coast, situate in a great champaign, but it is com-
passed with hills3 on the east, sixty furlongs off, with the
hill-country of Galilee; on the south with Carmel, distanb a
hundred and twenty furlongs 3 on the north, with a very high
mountain which is called Climax” (or the ladder>‚ “ belonging
to the Tyrians‚ and is a hundred furlongs distant. Two
miles off of that city the river Beleus flows, a very small one,
near which is the sepulchre of Memnon 3 having about it the
space of a hundred cubus but well worthy admiration. For
it is in the form of a round valley, affording glassy sand,
which when many ships coming thither have gathered, the
place is again replenishedh.”
