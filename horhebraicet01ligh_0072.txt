Psephin tower, of which Josephus y thus ; Θαυμασιῶτερος ἀνεῖχε
κατὰ γωνίαν βόρειός τε καὶ πρὸς δύσιν ὁ Ψήφινος, &Q “ On the
north-west corner, the admired Psephin tower lifts up itself,
near which Titus encaniped‚” Sne.

There was no gate on this north side. The buildings,
which were inward‚ are mentioned, Neh. iii, 20—243 and
the Hippio tower is mentioned by J osephus.

On the east were, 1. A tower, advancing itself in the very
bending of the north-east corner. Within was the ‘ King’s
House,' and the court of the prison, ver. 25. 2. The Water-
gate, of which is mention, Neh. xii. 37. 3. Ophel, and the
Home-gnte, Neh. iii. 27, 283 of which mention is also made,
J er. xxxi. 40. WVhence was the beginning of the valley of
Ben-Hinnom: which, running out below the city southward,
at last bent into the west. Therefore, the Water-gate led
into the valley of Kedron: but the Herse-gnte into the
valley of Hinnom, at that place touching on the valley of
Kedron. 4. The Gate Miphkad: the Vulgar calls it, The
Grate of J udgment. 5. Not far distant thence was the south-
east corner. And thence a little on the south side was the
Sheep-gate, whence we first set out.

Let us add the words of «Iosephus, describing how the
outmost wall went. ἈρχομένονΖ δὲ κατὰ βορρᾶν, &Q “ It
began 011 the north at the Hippio (01· horse) tower, and cx-
tended to the Xystus (or open 9allery); then touching upon
the Council-house‚ it ended at the east wall< of the Temple.
On the other side, westwardly, beginning from the same
tower, it stretched along by a place called Bethso, to the
gato of the Essenos3 and thence it inclined to the south be-
hind the fountain Siloam: and hence it bowed again east-
wardly unto Solomon⁷s pool, and passed on to a certain place,
which they call Ophla, and joined to the east walk of the
Te1nple.’'

In which words let us observe two things for the asserting
the procession that wc have gone 2—1. That this description
proceeds from the north to the west, the south, and the east.
2. That Ophla, or OpheL lay between the south—east corner
and the porch of the Temple; which cannot at all be con-
