Caesarea. Strato's Tower. 121

reus, &cz and, at the mouth of it, stood three great statues,
Sto. There were houses joining to the haven, and they also
were of white stone, &Q Over against the haven’s mouth
was the temple of Caesar, situate upon a rising ground, excel-
lent both for the beauty and greatness of it; and in it a large
statue of Caesar, &c The rest of the works, which he did
there, was an amphitheatre, a theatre, and a market‚ all
worthy to be nientioned‚” &ca See more in Josephus.

Caesarea was inhabited mixedly by Jews, heathens, and
Samaritans. Hence some places in it were profane and un-
clean to the Jews.

“ R. Niehomiq Bar R. Chaija Bar Abba saidr, My father
passed not under the arch of Caesarea3 but R. Immi passed.
R. Ezekiah, R. Cohen, and R. Jacob Bar Acha, walked in
the palace of Caesarea: when they came to the arch, R,
Oohen departed from them ; but when they came to a clean
place, he again betook himself to the1n.” This story is
recited Beracoth‚ fol. 6. 13 and there it is said that they
walked in the palace of Zippor.

“ OneS brought a bill of divorce from the haven of Cae-
sarea. Concerning which when judgment was had before R.
Abhu‚ he said, There is no need to say, It was written, Ι
being present,—and Ι being present, it was scaled. ΓΝἾ,
ΓἽΟᾪΞ ΓἾΟῬ Ῑῡω ΠῬῺΒ For the haven of Caesarea is not
as Gaesarea.''

Of the various strifes and uproars between the Caesarean
Greeks and Jews, in which the Jews always went by the
worst, Josephus hath very much. Ἑτέρα ταραχὴ συνίσταται
περὶ Καισάρειαν, τῶν ἀναμεμιγμένων Ἰουδαίων πρὸς τοὺς ἐν αὐτῇ
Σύρους στασιασάντων· “Another disturbance (saith het) was
raised at Caesarea, of the Jews mingled there, rising up against
the Syrians that were in it.'’ The contest was about priority
and chiefdom, and it was transacted before Nero, καῖ’1 οἱ Και-
σαρέων ’Έλληνες νικήσαντες, &Q “ And the Greeks of Caesarea
overcame‚'“ &a Where the reader will observe‚ that the
Syrians and Greeks are convertible terms.
