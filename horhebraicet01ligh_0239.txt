Jerusalem—Cadmi& 229

193 *tumn azy& τηᾞη nna& ‘⁶ to build the palaee for
which I ha've made provision.”

SECT. VL-Jerusalem, in Herodotus, is Oadytis.

Lm* us also salute Jerusalem, and that under its most glo-
rious name, ‘ The Holy City.’ Herodotus points it out, if we
are not much mistaken, under the name of Oadgstis. Ἀπὸ
Φοινίκης μέχρι οὕριων τῶν Καδύτιος πόλιος, ἡ ἐστὶ Συρίων τῶν
Παλαιστινῶν καλεομένων· “ F roms Phoenice unto the moun-
tains of Cadgstz's, which is the city of those Syrians who are
called Palestines.’' That Jerusalem is pointed out by him
under this name, these things following persuade me :

Ι. ItS was commonly called ΠΨἹἺΡ Kedoskah, Holy. The
J ewish money, wheresoever dispersed, spoke out this title of
the eityt. But now when it was very common in the Syrian
dialect to change w (Selom) into ,Π (Thau), how easy was it
among them, and among other nations imitating them, that
Oadysha should pass into Gadyta and Oaditis3 as ΠΞΠἾΠ Cha-
dasha, New, passed into ΠΓΠΠ Chadacha.

II. He compareth Occdpstz‘s to the great city of Sardis.
For Ἀπὸ δὲ Καδύτιος ἐούσης πόλιος (ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκέει) Σαρδίων οὐ
πολλῷ ἐλάσσονος· “From the city Cadystisf' as he goes 011,
⁶¹· not much less than Sardis, as I think.” But now there was
no city at all within Palestine worthy to be compared with
Sardis, a most famous metropolis in times past, except Je-
rusalem.

III. These things also he speaks of N echoh king of Egypt ε
Καὶ Σύροισι πεζῇ ὁ Νεκὼς συμβαλὼν ἐν Μαγδόλῳ ἐνίκησε.
Μετὰ δὲ τὴν μάχην Κάδυτιν πόλιν τῆς Συρίας ἐοῦσαν μεγάλην
εἷλε. “ Butu Necus joining in a foot battle with the Syrians
in Magdolus, obtained the victory: and after that, took
Cadytis the great city of Syria.''

Which passage, if it be compared with the holy story of
Pharaoh Nechoh overcoming J osiah in the battle in the vale
of Megiddo‚ and disposing of the Jewish throne, 2 Kings
xxiii. 33, 34, it fixeth the thing beyond all controversy.
