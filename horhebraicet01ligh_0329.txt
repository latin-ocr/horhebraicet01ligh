Emmaus. Timncttlc. λίθακι Θῖῖθαιί. 319

pipes into the Temple. This was 111 the same quarter from
Jerusalem with our Emmaus: so that our Ἐμμαοῦς may as
well be derived from ΠὮΝ Α mmatlc, (ι chamaal Qf malm, as
well as the other Ἀμμαοῦς from nnn Olcawzmcak, the warm
badas. But this Ι leave to the reader's judgment.

ln memory of this place, let us record a story out of Sige-
vert’s Chronicle, in the reigns of Theodosius and Valenti-
nianus: “ At this time, in a garrison in J udea called Em-
maus, there was a perfect child born. From the navel up-
ward he was divided, so that he had two breasts and two
heads‚ either of which had their proper senses belonging to
them: the one ate when the other did not, the one slept
when the other was awake Sometime 'they slept both to-
gether; they played one with another; they both wept, and
would strike one another. They lived near two years3 aud
after one had died the other survived about four days.”

If this two-headed child was the issue of a J ew, then h
might that question be solved which is propounded, (Mena-
coth, fol. 37. 1.) ΕἾΞΝἾ ’Ἕω Ἶι) Usu> ”2 If any] one should
have two heads, ’Dffiffln ΠΨ) ῙΓἹῸ Urs: on which of {laesore-
laeads should the pleylacterz‘es be bound ‚9 No mean scruple
indeed. But let us have from the Glossator as consider-
able a story: ⁶· Asmodeus produced, from under the pave-
ment before Solomon, a man wit-h two heads. He marries a
wife, and begot children like himself, with two heads, and
like his wife, with one. When the. patrimony comes to be
divided, he that bad two heads requires a double portion:
and the cause was brought before Solonion to be (lecided
by him.'’

As to that Thamna, 01· Timnath, which Josephus, 111 the
place above quoted, makes mention of, it is disputed in So-
tah, fol. 17. 13 where “ Rabh asserts that there were two
Timuaths, one in Judea‚ and the other that of Samson.''
We all know of a third of that name, ‚Joshua’s 'l'imnath,
viz. Timnath-serah in mount Ephraini, where ι1118111111. was
buried, Josh. xxiv. 30. Here give the Rabbins a little play,
and let them triste by transposing the names of ΠἽΕ) Sea-ala
and Duri Oloeres, and from thence ground a fiction, that the
image of the sun was fixed upon the sepulchre of Joshua. 111
