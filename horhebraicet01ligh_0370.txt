among the Rabbins, that when the Asmonean family mu-

canus within, every day they that were besieged within let
down their money by the wall in a little box, which those
that were without received, and sent them back their daily
sacrifice. It came to pass that there was an old man amongst
them skilled in the wisdom of the Greeks, that told them,
‘ So long as they within perform their worship, you will never
be able to subdue them.’ Upon this, the next day they let
down their money, and the besiegers sent them back a hog;
when the hog had got· half up the wall, fixing his feet upon
it, the land of Israel shook four hundred leagues round about.
From that time they said, ‘Cursed be he that breedeth swine:
cursed be he that teacheth his son the wisdom of the Greeks?

Gaggoth Zeriphin, and the two loaves from the valley Ein
SycharF'
