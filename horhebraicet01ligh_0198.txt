III. From the cities let us walk forth into their ploughed
grounds and fields.

Here you might see, in some placeS, certainh tokens hung
upon some fig-trees, to show of what year the fruit that grew
there was. See what we say on Matt. xxi. 19. In other
places, you might see barren trees stigmatized with some
mark of infamy. ‘⁵ Ai tree which shook off its fruits before
they were ripe, ΝἾῙῗἿῦΞ itu& 3³757'10 they mark with red,
and load it with stones.”

’ You might see the ploughing and mowing of their fields,
the dressing of their vines, and their vintage, to be done by
the rules of the scribes, as well as by the art of the hus-

of what things such corners ought to consist? Ofm those that

reaping is various? What0 are the trees whose fruits are
Demai? Ofv what things is the tithing of the Demai? Howq
long the same plot of ground may be sown with different
seeds, so as not to offend against the law? Of sowing different
seeds :—Howr many vines make a vineyal’d? Of their rows,
of the beds of the vineyard, of sowing within the press, &c
and innumerable decisions of that nature, which did so keep
