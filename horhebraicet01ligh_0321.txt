Nain. 311

with our Nain: for it is very absurd to conceive that our
Saviour ever was at Hazar-enan, the utmost borders of the
land towards Syria3 nor can we suppose him in ljon, that
seeming to be according to the order of the places as they are
ranked in the text above quoted, either beyond Dan, or in
the extremest borders of the land on that side.

As to our Naiu, Borchard saith thus ; ‘² A Nazareth duabus
leucis,” &a “ Two leagues from Nazareth, not much above
one from mount Tabor southward, is mount Hermon the
less, on the north side of which is the city Nain3 at whose
gates Jesus recovered a widow's son from death, as we read
Luke vii.” So also Breidenbach: so some tables as to the
situation of Hermon and Tabor, near the situation of Nain
near Hermon.

I ani well enough satisfied that they should place Nain in
the tribe of Issachar, if there be no mistake among them
as to mount Tabor. For whereas Tabor is indeed the very
utmost border of Issaehar northward, J osh. xix. 22, ith must
needs be that what is beyond that southward, a league or
two, should be reckoned within that tribe. But I much sus-
pect the Tabor mentioned by them, and that which is now
shewn to travellers, is not the true Tabor: nor do Ι much
question but that Hermon, of which they talk, is made out
of a mistake and misconstruction of Psalm lxxxix. ῐ 2, “Tabor
and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.'’ My scruple as to
mount Tabor ariseth hencei 3 because that k Tabor, which is
shewn to strangers, as our countryman Biddulphl, and another
acquaintance of mine own, who were on the top of it, do de-
scribe it, does not at all agree with the description ‘Iosephus
gives us of the true mount Tabor. Our countryman tells us,
‘⁶ It is a hill not very steep, nor very high, nor very large3
but a round beautiful hill,” &a On the contrary, Ἰταβύριον
ὅρος οὗ τὸ μὲν ὕψος ἐπὶ τριάκοντα σταδίους ἀνίσχει, μόλις προσ-
βατὸν κατὰ τὸ προσάρκτιον κλίμα, πεδίον δέ ἐστιν ἡ κορυφὴ, στα-
δίων ἓξ καὶ εἴκοσι· “ Mountm Tabor is in height thirty furlongs,
very difficult of ascent on the north side; the top is a great
plain of about six-and-twcnty furlongs.''
