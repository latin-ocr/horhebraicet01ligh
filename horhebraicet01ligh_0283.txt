THESE places are named in the line bounding the land
southward. N umb. xxxiv. and Josh. xv,

The Jews teach us, that it was called the ⁶ Desert of Zin’
from a mountain of that name, and that the mountain was
so called from the groves of palm-trees,· and that it was
famous for iron minos, For those words, Numb. xxxiv. 4,
1733 ἾΞΞῘᾎ “ And pass on to Zin‚'' are rendered by the J eru-
salem 'farigumisn &ltu-³³2 ἾἾἾΖΟ ἾΠΞΠ “ And the border passed
on to the mountain of Iron.” By Jonathan, ³3³2& unm,
Νἶῖἲῆε) 'ivm “ And passed on to the pahns of the mountain
of Iron.''—³]³³B‚ in the Talnmdists, are [esser palues.—Rabl1n
Judah saith, He that sells a farm to his neighbour, must
write, Possess to thyself, ΓῬΞἾ ζἛἾιἻἸ ΓίἳδέΠἹ ΓίῖζὶἾΡ-ῙΛΘῈ
the Aruch be an interpreter for us :—

‘⁵ 355377 are loftier palm-trees.

‘⁵ ΓῖἳΝΠ are the rest· of the greater trees.

“ ΓΒἾΠ are the rest of the smaller trees.

“ ΓΞἛ are the smaller palm-trees.”

And the Talmudists again mum: ‘7352 ἾΠ ἛἛ “ The0
palms of the mountain of Iron are fit? to make a bunch to
hold in the haud in the feast of Tabernacles. &Vhere the
(Mosa—'¹353 are smaller palme.

It seeum, therefore, to be some mountainous tract, very
near to the borders of the land of Israel, famous for palms of
a lower sizo, ancl iron-mines, called, from its palm-trees, 3³13
Τεΐη, and from that name giving a denomination to the adja-
cent country, which was desert.

Cadesh, in the eastern interpreters ΕρἾ Bekam, was a
bound of the land3 yet Cadesh itself was, in effect, without
the land. Hence those words, ‘⁶ Hep that brings a bill from
a heathen place, &c.; γοα, that brings it- from Rcka1n.” And,
“ Allq the spots that come from Rekam are clean.’' The
Gloss is, ‘⁸ Some spots in the ga1·ments” (namcly, of a proflu-
vious woman) “ which came from Rekam were clean, because
they determined not of the spots of st1·ang01·S.'' Another
