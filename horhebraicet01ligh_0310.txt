last I presume lnost probable3 and so we place Trachonitis
in the extreme parts of the Transjordanine country towards
the east. And both which, upon these reasons taken to—
gether:

1. The Gemafists, describing the circumference of the land
from the north, do mention 172 UffiWDss‘J ΠᾶιῖἯ ΝΚἊᾺΞἾΠ

the upper, which is above Caesarea [Philippi]‚ and Trachona,
which extends to Bozraht :'' where the extension of Trachona
must not be understood 01 its reaching to some Bozrah in
those northern borders 3 but to some Bozrah 01· Bosorrah in
the confines of Pereau: and so it supposes the country ex-
tending itself from the north towards the south.

2. ΒαταναίαςΧ χώρας, “ Of the province of Batanea3 east
of which is saccea, and here, ulide‘r the hill Alsadamus, are
the Trachonite Arabians.” Behold here the Trachonites living
east of Batanea.

3. “H τεῩ Γαμαλιτικὴ καὶ Γαυλανῖτις, Βαταναία τε καὶ Τραχω-
νῖτις· “The country of Gamala, and Gaulanitis, and Batanea‚
and Trachonitis.” But were not Gamalitica itself and Gaulo-
nitis within Batanea ? Right z but by this distinction he divides
between that Batanea that was nearer Galilee, and that that
was farther off. That country that lay nearest, from those
noted towns of Gaulan and Gamala, he calls Gaulonitis and
Gamalitica3 and that which was farther off, he calls by its
own name of Batanea; and what lies still beyond that, Tra—
chonitis.

There was a time when all that whole country, which now
is distinguished into these severals, had one general name of
Bas-han,- which word, how it came to change into Bathan, 01·
Batanea‚—as also, with the Targuinists and Samaritans, into
Bathnin and Mathnin‚——any one, indifferently skilled in the
Syrian tongue, will easily discern.
