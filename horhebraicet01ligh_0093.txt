Kedron. 83

dering abroad either into a strange or more unusual dialect,-
when the word UD Pherai most vulgarly‚ and in all men's
mouths, denotes “green figs,'' which mount Olivet was not a
little famous for? For although it took its name from ⁵ Olives'
yet it produced both ⁶ fig' trees and ‘palms 3' and according
to the variety of these, growing in divers tracts of the mount,
so various names were imposed upon those tracts, which we
note elsewhere. That lowest part, therefore, of the moun-
tain, which runs out next the city, is called, from the green
figs, “ Betllpliage:” by which name also that part of J ern-
salem, next adjacent, is called, by reason of the vicinity of
that place. And from these things, well regarded, one may,
more rightly and plainly, understand the story of Christ
coming this way.

He had lodged in Bethany, the town of Lazarus, John
xii. 1. From thence, in the morning, going onward, he is
said to come to Bethphage, and Bethany, Mark xi. 1 ; that
is, to that place, where those tracts of the mountain, known
by those names, did touch upon one another. And when he
was about to ascend into heaven, he is said to lead out his
disciplae, Ἕως εἰς Βηθανίαν, “ as far as Bethany,'’ Luke
xxiv. 503 but not farther than a sabbath-day's journey,
Acts i. 123 whereas the town, where Lazarus dwelt, was
almost twice as far, John xi. 18. He went, therefore, out of
Jerusalem through Bethphage within the walls, and Beth-
phage without the walls,—and measuring a sabbath-day’s
journey, or thereabouts, arrived at that place and tract of
Olivet, where the name of Bethphage ceased, and the name
of Bethany began; and there he ascended. I doubt, therc-
fore‚ whether there was any town in Olivet called Bethphage ;
but rather a great tract of the mountain was so called ; and
the outermost street of Jerusalem within the walls was called
by the same name, by reason of its nearness to that tract.
