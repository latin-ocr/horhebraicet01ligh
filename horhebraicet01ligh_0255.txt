A coast. 245

“ I am not sent but to the lost sheep of lsrael only ;’' and to
his disciples, “Gro not into the way of the Gentiles ς’) and,
“ If these wonderful works had been done in y Tyre and
Sidon;'’—you will never persuade me that he ever went as far

as the gates of Sidon.
ΙΙ. Ι1 18 said by St.Ma1·k, that after that maid was

healed, Christ came “from the coast of Tyre and Sidon to
the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the coasts of De-
capolis.'' What! from the gate of Sidon 1ο 1116 sea of
Galilee, through the midst of Decapolis? It would have
been more properly said, “Through the midst of Galilee:''
and hence, as it seems, some have been moved to place
Decapolis within Galilee, with no reason at all. We shall
meet with it in another place, in the following chapter, and
in such a place, that it is not easy to conceive how Christ
could pass through it from the gate of Sidon to the sea of

Galilee.

SECT. Ile—‘7722 ’Ὀριοιγ A coast.

To determine concerning ὁρίοις Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος, “ 1116
coasts of Tyre and Sidon,'' in this story, we first propound
this to the reader: 11 18 said, 1 Kings ix. 11, 12, that
“solomon gave to Hiram, the king of the Tyrians, twenty
citiesZ in Galilee :” which when he had seen and liked them
not, “ he called the land ³7³2? Chabul unto this day.” The
LXX render it, ἐκάλεσευ αὐτὰς ”Οριου, “he called them the
border or coast.'’ Now let any one, I beseech you, skilled in
the tongues, tell me what kin there is between ¹:³³1: and
‘'Optov, α bound, or coast, that moved the LXX so to render
ita.

The Talmudists speak various things of the word 3:³52)
Chabal: but the sense and signification of the word ‘'Opcov,
