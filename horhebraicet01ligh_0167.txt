History of Tiberias. 157

naum was in that country,—we must necessarily suppose that
it was not very remote from Tiberias,

It was παραθαλασσία, ἐν ὁρίοις Ζαβουλὼν καὶ Νεφθαλεὶμ,
“ upon the sea-coasts, in the borders of Zabulon and Neph-
thali,” Matt. iv. 13 z—not that it was the bounds of each, but
because it was within the borders of Zabulon and Nephthali,
they being put in opposition to the other parts of Galilee.
So Μεθόρια Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος, “the borders of Tyre and
Sidon,” Μαι-1( vii. 24, denote not that very centre where the
territories of Tyre are parted from those of Sid0n3 but the
“bounds of Tyre and Sid0n‚” as distinguished from the
bounds of Galilee. Nevertheless, neither was this city far
distant from the very limas, where the bounds of Zabulon
and Nephthali did touch upon one another‚—nan1ely‚ near
the south coast of the sea of Gennesaret‚ which we observed
before.

We suppose Capernaum seated between Tiberias and Ta-
richee. Whether Κεφαρυώμη, &epher-nome, in Jose1>husa‚ be
the same with this, we do inquire.

ments, and liberality, to invite inhabitants. The very de-
lightful situation of the place seemed to put him on to wrestle
with such a difficulty and inconvenience‚ rat-her than not to
enjoy so pleasant a soil and seat. For on this side, the sea
washing upon it,—on that side, within a little way, Jordan
gliding by it‚—on the other side, the hot baths of Ghannnath,
—and on another, the most fruitful country Gennesaret ad-
jacent‚—did every way begird this city, when it was builtC,
with pleasure and delight.

It did every day increase in splendonr, and became at last
the chief city not only of Galilee but of the whole land of
