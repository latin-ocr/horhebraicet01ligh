Beth Illaron, and a Maronite. 377

πολίχνια· after which lte took Beth-el ancl Ephraim, two little
cities.’'

In the Targumist it is written *fvit-37 with a Vau, and is
thus pointed pst-³33, and rendered by the Greek interpreters
Ἐφρῶν, Ephron. But the Masorah tells us it must be read
by Jod, ΓἻΞΏ Ephraim. Nor do Ι question but that it is
the same with Josephus’s Ephraim, and the ΟἾἿΞΨ Ephraim
of the Talmudists ¹1, of which we have discoursed in our Gho-
rographical Century, chap. liii.

It is probable it was a city in the land of Benjamin‚ as also
was Beth-el, which is mentioned at the same time with it.
Now Beth-el was the utmost border of the tribe of Benjamin Χ,
as it lay towards the tribe of Ephraim Υ. But where this
Ephraim should lie, it is not so plain. Only this our evan-
gelist speaks of it,-—that it was “ near the wilderness ;'' that
is (as it should seem), near the wilderness of Judea, in the
way from Jerusalem to J ericho.

‘⁶ THEREZ goes a story os a brother and a sister: he was
in 317„ um Gush Hala65 she in ζἾἾὩ rr: Beth Maron.
There happened a fire in his house, that was in Gush Halab;
his sister comes from Beth Maron, and embraced and kissed
him‚”

Now 2er mu Gusk Ηαῖαό was in the tribe of Asher, as
appears in Menaeotha: where there is a story of a most
precious oil bought in Gush Halab, in the tribe of Asher,
such as could not be bought in any other place.

And so perhaps that may be understood of ἶἾἾῃ ,ΠἾΞ Beth
Maron, being so near to Gush Halab, which we meet with
in Jerusalem Kiddushinb5 ἾἾ ΠὛΠΨ *ww mun: mmm
