Ecdippa. Ackzib. Tyriam. 135

Of Amanah we shall speak by and by. “ The river (saith
R. Solomon upon the place) is the river of Egypt.”—“ And
Chezib (saith Rambama) is the name of a place, which
divided between the land of Israel, which they possessed that
came up out of Babylon, and that land which they possessed
that came up out of Egypt. Now that land, which they
possessed that came up out of Egypt, as to the Demai'' (or
doubt of tithing), “ is, as it were, without the land? Hence
is that in the text, on which he makes this comment, 2³³3&

ἾΝὮἺΠ VD ἾἸΤΔΞ ἵζ’)ΠζῬἸ “ From Ohezib‚ and beyond, is free
from the Demai.”

The word Okezz‘b, and Achab, at last passed into Ecdippa,
according to the manner of the Syrian dialect ; to which it is
common to change ἲ (Zain) of the Hebrews into Ἴ (Daleth.)

Κλίμαξ Τυρίων, “ Olimax (or tlte ῖασῖοίθν) of the Tyrians,'' in
the Talmudists is ἻἸἘἻ Πῖὶῖἶῆῦ, ‘The ladder of Tyre.' Νι)
’ἹΞἾ ἿἾΞἾ rmbwb ῙἿΤΔὮ “ Beforeb they came to Climax of
the Tyrians, they forgot all.''—The discourse is, in the place
cited, about some Romans sent to Rabban Gamaliel, to
inquire of the Jewish law.

Of him also is this story, and of the same place : “ thenC
he went sometime out of Chezib, one came to him, to ask
him of a certain vow of his. He said to him, who went with
him, Tell him, that we have drunk an Italian quart of wine.
He saith to him, Well. He saith to him that asked, Go with
us, until our wine be allayed. W hen they came ‘7127 nni->5037
ἻἾΣζ to tlce Zaclder of the Tyriam, Rabban Gamaliel came down,
and veils himself, and, sitting, resolved his vow. From this
example we learn these things, that a quart of wine makes
one drunk, that the way allays wine,” &c.

Let this be marked by the way, that it is said ΓἿ ,ΠΨἮἾ
ΠὋΨὈ “A quart of wine makes drunk:” and let it be
compared with what R. Chaia saith, '¹12³ mm: ΠὩΞἾΝ
“ Fourd pots (to be drunk by every one in their sacred
feasts) contain an Italian quart of wine :’' and judge how
soberly they carried it in those feasts, if they mingled not
much water with their wine.
