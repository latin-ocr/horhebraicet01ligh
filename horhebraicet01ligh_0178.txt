Targum of Jerusalem there reads ῙἿἾἾΒῬἾ &Ljum'ffi “ Tor-
negola of Caesarion.'’ Now that Caesarea which they mean
is ⁶ Caesarea Philippi,' which is at the fountain of Jordan: and
that Gabara is called UNlffiy &bunun ‘⁶ Gabara the upper,''
for distinetion'sy sake, from other eities of the same name.
J osephus calleth “ Tiberias Ζ, Sipphor, and Gabara, ’' the
three greatest eities of Galilee. He mentions also Γαβαρὼθ
κώμην, the town Gabarotha, and Γαβαραγαυαίους, Gabar-a-
ganeib, which are reekoned with the Gadarenes and Tyrians
by him.

G H ΑΡ. LXXXVI.

The diffbrence ofsome czcstoms oftlze Galz'leans from
those of J aclea.

IT is not impertinently questioned, with what inhabitants
Galilee and Perea were first planted after the return out of
Babylon, when you searee find any mention of them in the
Books of Ezra and Neheniiah, but of those only who in-
habited J udea and the land of Benjamin. But whosoever
they were, whether pure Israelites, or those that were more
mixed, or some of the ten tribes, it is certain those that
inhabited Galilee differes] mueh from those that dwelt in
Judea, in certain rites, and not a little in the dialect of
their speech.

The -Jewish pandet-ts observe a various difference between
them: out of which we produce these few instances instead
of more :—

In the place noted (ἶ in the margin, it is discoursed eon-
cerniug the form and manner of writing the donation of the
marriage dowry. “ So and so (say they) the people of J eru-
salem writ, and the (ialileans writ as those of Jerusalem:
but the inhabitants of Judea something varied,'’ 8520. WVhere
