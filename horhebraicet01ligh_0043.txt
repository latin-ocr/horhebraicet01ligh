Ascalon. Gerar. 33

neW. For thus he writes : “ Tl1ence” (from Azotus) “is new
Ascalon distant two parsae, or leagues” (that is, eight miles) ;
“ which Ezra, the priest, of blessed memory, built at the sea-
shore z and they called it, first, ³1:⁸12: now that is distant
from old Ascalon, now destroyed, four leagues.⁷'

So that, from Azotus to Ascalon, of which we are speaking,
and of which alone the Holy Scripture speaks, were, by his
computation, four—and-twenty miles ς and by the computation
of Adrichomius, two hundred furlongs, that is, five-and-twenty
miles.

“ Ten miles from Gaza'' (says our countryman Sandes [San-
dys] 0, an eyewitness), “and near the sea, is placed Ascalon, now
of no note, anciently a venerable place to the heathen for the
temple of Dagon, and the festivals of Semiramis's birthday.”

From Gaza to Azotus, Diodorus Siculus ‘¹ being witness,
are two-hundred and severity furlongs: which amount to four-
and-thirty miles: namely, from Gaza to Ascalon, ten miles,
and thence to Azotus four-and-twenty.

That is a common saying, ΒἹἾἾΙῬ ἶἾῖἳρζΠΝῃ, &c. ‘¹ From ί·
Ascalon onward to the south, is the heathen country, and
Ascalon itself is reputed for a heathen country.'’ And yet
something of Ascalon was within the land of Israel. &³³32
ἶἾῖἳῦῐζῖΝἺ The appZe-yardens or orchards, did bound the
land of Ascalon on that coast, which we have observcd be-
fore. And yet, ‘⁶ whens R. Ismael Ben R. Josi, and Ben
Hakkaphar, were set over 3553?th ἾἻἸΝ ³737 the space of
Ascalon'' (that is, when it was intrusted to thern to judgc
concerning the spaces or parts of Ascalon,—namely, what
were within the land, and what without, ἅδε.) “they pro—
nounced it clean from the authority of R. Phinchasi Ben J air,
who said, We went down to the corn-market of Ascalon, and
thence we received wheat, and going up into our city wc
washed, and ate our Thruma ;'' i. e. The portion of first-fruits
belonging to the priests. The greatest part of the city, if
not the whole, was esteemed, under the second Temple, to be
without thc limits of the land: but some part, or at least tho
apple-yards, and the places next adjacent, were within the land.
