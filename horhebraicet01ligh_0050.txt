“ Lydda is a part of J udea.’' Let some maps mark this,
which have placed a certain Lod, which never was any where,
not fal· from J ericho, asu was said before3 because Lod, in
the land of Benjamin, is brought in, Neh. xi. 35: but they
set Lydda far beyond the bounds of J udea in the land of
Ephraim. ’

“ Koshab Bar Ullax sometime got away to Lydda to Rabbi
Josua Ben Levi, dwelling there, when he fied from the Ro-
mans. The Romans pursued him, and besieged the city.
Unless you deliver him to us, say they, we will destroy the
city. R. Josua Ben Levi persuaded him, and he was de-
livered to the Romans.”

Ι might produce numberless things celebrating the name
of Lydda3 such as, *1³52 m& rw: ΠἾἾῖἋ), “ The>r chamber of
Beth-Arum in Lydda? 7³52 Πῖἰὶι) ΠἾΞ. ΠἾἿῖῒἯ “ Thez cham-
ber of Beth-lebam in Lydda.” 1173 mm ni: nn‘w ⁶ss Theu
chamber of Beth-Nethaza in Lydda.”—We suppose these
were schools.

I might mention very many names of Rabbins residing at
Lydda, besides those whom I have remembered before: such
are, R. Chama Bar Chaninab, and R. Hoshaia with him.
R. Illai ⁰, and R. Eliezer 3 and others, who are vulgarly called
the Seuthem, in the sense we produced before. Concerning
R. Josua Ben Levi, by name, the author of Juchasin hath
these words, *HN 0³57: mmm* “ His d habitation, or college,
was in the south of the land of Israel.’' He means Lydda.

R. Eliezer, dying at Caesarea, desired to be buried at
Lydda, whom R. Akibah bewailed as well with blood as
tears. “ Fore when he met his hearse betwixt Caesarea and
Lydda, he beat himself in that manner, that blood flowed
down upon the earth. Lamenting, thus he spoke,—O my
father, my father, the chariot and horsemen of Israel. I
have much money, but I want a lnoneyer, to change it.’' The
Gloss is this, “ l have very many questions; but now there
is no man, to whom I may propound them.''

There is a place between Jamnia and Lydda, which was
