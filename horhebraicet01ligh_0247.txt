Pomp of those that offered the first-fruita 237

this was near Jerusalem 3 and perhaps there were more
places of that name in the land of Israel. For as that word⁴
denotes the Tower of a Floclc, so those towers seem to have
been built for the keeping of flocks; that shepherds might be
there ready also a·nights; and that they might have weapons
in a readiness to defend their floeks, not only from wild
beasts, but from robbers also. And to this sense we suppose
that expression, ΒἾἾΞἾ] 'Tum ⁸ the Tower of the KeeperS,'

the city. Take it in the words of the masters, in the place
citedS in the margin :

“ Aftert what manner did they bring their first-fruits3
All the cities 'mymzw which were (gf one station'' (that is,
out of which one course of priests proceeded) “ were gathered
together into a stationary city, and lodged in the streetS.
In the morning, he who was the first among them said,
Arise‚ let us go up to Zion, to the house of the Lord our
God.’'

“ An ox went before them with gilded horns, and an olive
erown upon his head⁷⁵ (the Grloss is, that ox was sor a peace-
