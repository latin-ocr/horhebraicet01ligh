Abilene. 305

Tiberias, that was three stories high; had a lower, a middle,
and an upper dining-room 0. Which, indeed, was fortified,
and held a garrison of soldiers in it.

So that we may, not without reason, conjecture the Iturea
of which we now speak might be so called from ἾἾἾΓΡΠ
Ohitture, such kind of diyy'inys under ground: and that
Pliny and Strabo, when they talk of the ‘⁶ nation of the Itu-
reans in Cyrrhestica and Ohalcis‚’' do not place the country
of Iturea there 3 only hinted that the Troglodytes, who dwelt
in dens and caves, were there.

Iturea therefore, mentioned by our evangeliste, was in the
country beyond Jordan, viz. Batanea and Auranitis, or Au-
ranitis alone, as may appear out of J osephus, compared with
this our evangelist. For St. Luke saith, that ‘² Philip was
teti-arch of Iturea and Trachonitis:” J osephUS, that he was
tetrarch of Trachonitis, Batanea, and Auranitis. Either,
therefore, Auranitis and Batanea in J osephus is the Iturea in
St. Luke, or else Batanea in -Josephus is confounded with
Trachonitis mentioned in St. Luke, and Auranitis alone is
Iturea. For that passage in ‚Iosephus P ought to be taken
notice of: Δωρεῖται τὸν Ἀγρίππαν τῇ Φιλίππου τετραρχίᾳ, καὶ
Βαταναίᾳ, προσθεὶς αὐτῷ τὴν Τραχωνῖτιν σὺν Ἀβέλλᾳ· “ Gaesar
invests Agrippa with the tetrarchy that Philip had, and Ba-
tanea, adding moreover Trachonitis with Abella.’' Where
it is observable, that there is mention of the tetrarchy of
Philip, distinct from Batanea and Trachonitis. And what

is that? certainly Auranitis in Josephus, and perhaps Iturea
in St. Luke.

Josapuus, in the words before quoted, speaking ol' Abella,
adds this passagc3 Λυσανίᾳ δὲ αὕτη ἐγεγόνει τετραρχία, “ that
had been the tetrarchy of Lysanias.” So also Ptolemy,
Ἀβίλα ἐπικληθεῖσα Λυσανίου, “ Abila, that bore the name of
Lysanias :'’ and he reckons this up among the cities of Coelo-
syria, under these degrces :—-

Heliopolis 68. 40. 33. 40.
Abila . . 68. 45. 33. 20.
Plinyq speaks of Abila in that count-ry: “ Paneas, in qua (Ηυ-
