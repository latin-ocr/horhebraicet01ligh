Tlee wilderness ofJudala. 213

If you ask where David was when he composed that
Psalm, it is answered (ι Sam. xxiv. 1), ‘⁴ In the wilderness
of En-gedi :'' and if you search further for the precise place,
it was there where the castle Masada was afterward built.
For I doubt not at all, that that place, as J osephusg describes
it, was the same with 0Ἷῖῗᾷιῖῆῇ ἾᾜΣζ “ the rocks of the wild
goatS.” [1 Sam. xxiv. 3.] ⁴

Ι appeal here to the maps and their authors, in whom
‘ En-gedi' and ‘ Masada' (and ‘ Lot's cave') are placed not
very far from the utmost north coast of Asphaltites: let
them say whether Idumea stretched out itself so far. If not,
let them correct the interpreters whom we have named3 and
though it be so, they might show by what authority they
place those places there, and let them friendly correct me
putting them far elsewhere.

of Judalz, or Idumea adjacent.

Wssh are now indeed out of our bounds; but we hope
not out of the bounds of truth. Therefore, in one or two
words, we thus confirm the situation that we have assigned
to these places:

Ι. In Gen. x. 19, Gaza and Sodom are made to lie in a
parallel line.

II. Lasha is Callirrhoe. So Jonathan renders &KZ-3³2 *132

‘ unto Lasha,’ ‘'n-YWLJ'D '137 ‘ unto Callirrhoe.' So also Bere-
shith Rabbahi, and the Jerusalem T almudists k, in the places
cited at the margin.

You have the situation of itin Pliny, on the same coast
with MacheruS. ‘⁶ Arabial of the Nomades looks upon
Asphaltites on the east,—-Macherus‚ on the south. On the
same side is Callirrhoe, a warm spring, of a medicinal whole-
somenesS.''

And now let it be observed, from the place alleged out
of Genesis, that, after the same manner as Sidon and Gaza,
the limits on the west part, are placed, so are Sodom and
Lasha seated on the east, one on the south, and the other
