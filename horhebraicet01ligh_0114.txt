Ben Samuel said, The whole face of the east is light unt-0
Hebron : to whom another answers, W ell‚'' &c. Upon which
words RambamC t.hus; ‘·‘ There was a high place in the
Temple, whither he who was sent to see went up3 and when
he saw the face of the east shining‚ he said, ἾΝΙΤἮ It is light,
διο. And they who were in the court, said, ῙἹἾΠΠἎ &anm 'ty
What! As the light is unte Hebron ?—Tl1at is, Is the light
come so far, that thine eyes may see Hebron 3-And he an-
swered, Yes.'' So also the Gloss upon Tainid3 ‘⁶ The morn-
ing (saith he, who is on the roof) is seen as far as Hebron3
because they could see Hebron thence.”

“ Andd therefore they made mention of Hebron, (although
the east was on that coast), that the memory of the merit
of those, that were buried in Hebron, might occur at the
daily sacrifice.” They are the words of the author of Ju-
chasin, out of which those are especially to be marked,
‘⁶ Though the east was on that coast 3⁹³ or, “ Though the east
were on that quarter of the heaven.'' Oonsider which words,
and consult the Gemarists upon the place quoted: for they
understand those words,--“ W hat! As the light is unto
Hebron ?”’--of the light reaching as far as Hebron3 just as
the Gloss understands them of his eyes reaching thither that
went to look. All which things compared, come at last to
this‚—if credit may be given to these authors—that Hebron,
however it be placed south of Jerusalem, yet did decline
somewhat towards the east, and might be seen srom the
high towers in the Temple and in Jerusalem. Let the reader
judge.

Of Machpelah, the burying-place near Hebron, very many
things are said by very many men. The city was called
Hebron, that is, a consociatio& —perhaps, from the pairs
there buried, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.

Not a few believe Adam was buried there in like manner:
some, that he was bnried once, and buried again. “ Adam
said, (say theye), Α fter my death, they will come perhaps, and,
taking my bones, will worship them; but I will hide my coffin
very deep in thc earth, ‘in a cave within a cave.’ It is there-
fore callcd, the cave Maehpelah, or the cloublecl cave.’'
