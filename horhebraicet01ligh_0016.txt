included all the neighbouring places, and which are, as it
were, swallowed up by the land. They say, therefore, that
the more remote places are called, ΕἾΠ ,ΠΞἾἻὈ ‘ The region
of the sea.’ But neither does this please me: for there is no
need of so great a distance, to make any place to be called,
‘ The region of the sea,' Sto. But it is spoken in relation to
the western coast of the land of Israel; on which side there
are no [becumen] cities near, and swallowed up by the land.
But the sea sets the bounds ς but it doth not set the bounds
on other sides, &c The sense, therefore, of R. Solonion,
when he saith, ‘that every region, without the land, is the
region of the sea,’ comes to this,——-That every region, which is
like to that region, is so called.”

Heathen cities were on that western coast; but seeing

gether ‘ without the limits.’ Those cities and that country,
therefore, are called by a peculiar title, :im-i ΠΞἾἾΧ) that is,
the “ coast or country by the Mediterranean sea.” Which
title all other cities os the like condition underwent also,
wheresoever seated within the bounds of the land. Exam-
ples will not be wanting as we go along.

Theyd commonly define the ‘land of Israel' under a double
notion: to wit, that :ram '³7³9 ΠΖ ἾΡἾΠΠΨ “ which they

narrower limits than that, not only by reason Samaria was
rejected and shut out,-—b11t also, because certain porticus
were cut off (and they neither a few nor small), which became
the possessions of those, that went up 0111 of Egypt; but,
