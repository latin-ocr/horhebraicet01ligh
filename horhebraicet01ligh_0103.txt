Nob. Bahzorim. 93

Saul. This signifieth Saul's-hilh which is distant from J eru-
salem about thirty furlongs.” Hence you may guess at the
distance of Rama from Jerusalem. Josephus calls the neigh-
bouring place of Gibeah, Ἄκανθῶυ αὐλῶνα· “ the long Valley
of Thorns:” perhaps, the valley under the rock Senes& [3730] .·
of which mention is made, 1 Sam. xiv. 4. ³ .

Nob. Bali-arim.

Tum Nob was placed in the land of Benjamin, not far
from Jerusalem, whence Jerusalem also might be seem—the
words of the Chaldee paraphrast, upon Isa. x. 32, do argue.

The Talmudistsb do concur also in the same sense with
the Chaldee paraplwast, and in his very words; adding this
m01·eover,—tl]at all those places, which are numbered-up by
Isaiah in the place alleged, were travelled through by the
enemy with his army in one day.

The tabernacle sometime resided at Nob, when that was
destroyed, it. was translated to Gibeon. “ And the days of
N ob and Gibeon” (they are the words of Maimonidesc) “ were
