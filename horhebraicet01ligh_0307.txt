The counfry beyond Jordan. 297

4. There is mention of ῑτηῖη rubba Gelilom ofJordw,
Joshua xxii. 11, when the passage was concerning Perea:
whence that country might well take its name of Galilee.

SEc'r. III—Some thiozqs in yeneral concor-nimy the country
beyond Jordan.

As to the tetrarchies of Herod and Philip, this, Ι suppose,
we may determine without prejudice or question, that nothing
was within their jurisdiction but what was within the con-
fines of the land of lsrael, properly so called. As to what
may be objected concerning Iturea‚ we shall consider in its
own place. Whilst we are, therefore, looking into these coun-
tries, our main business will be with what was beyond Jordan ;
for that on this side the river was only Galilee, about which
we shall not much trouble ourselves‚ because there is no diffi-
culty concerning it.

The Transjordanine country, if Ι mistake not, from greatest
antiquity, is divided in that story, Gen. xiv. 5: “Chedor-
laomer, and the kings that were with him, smote the Re-
phaims in Ashtaroth-karnaim‚ and the Zuzims in Ham,
and the Emims in Shaveh-kiriathaim‚ and the Horites in
mount Seir.”

These two things we may apprehend from this passage:
1. That the country of Bashan was inhabited by the Re-
phaims 3 Perea (another part of the land beyond Jordan), by
the Zuzims, Moab by the Emims. 2. That. Ashtaroth-kar-
naim, Ham, and Shaveh-kiriathaim are not every one the
names of whole countries, but particular places in those coun-
tries3 perhaps where the several fights were, οι· where the
people of that country had been subdued.

As to Ashtaroth-karnaim, there is little doubt but that
was in the kingdom of Bashan3 the larger region being called
Ashtaroth, Karnaim is added in a distinguishing limited sense:
Deut. i. 4, “Og, the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Ashtaroth
in Edrei.''
