chlias -Betlzsaidffi 179

Herod, called before ‘ Betharamphtha :' of which J osephus;
Βηθαραμφθᾶ δὲ, πόλις ἣν καὶ αὕτη, τείχει περιλαβὼν, Ἰουλιάδα
ἀπὸ τοῦ αὐτοκράτορος ἀγορεύει τῆς γυναικός· “ Ata Betha-
ramphtha‚ which before was the city's name, Herod com-
passed Julias with a wall, calling it by the name of the
empress.” The other built by Philip, heretofore called Beth-
saida, of which the same author writes thus: κώμην δὲ
Βηθσαϊδὰν, πρὸς λίμνῃ τῇ Γεννησαρίτιδι, πόλεως παρασχὼν
ἀξίωμα, πλήθει τε οἰκητόρων καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ δυνάμει, Ἰουλίᾳ θυ-
γατρὶ τῇ Καίσαρος ὁμώνυμον ἐκάλεσεν· “ Philip b, having raised
the town Bethsaida on the lake of Gennesaret to the honour
of a city, both in respect of the number os the inhabitants,
and other strength, gave it the same name with J ulia, the
emperor's daughter.'’

TheC maps have one J ulias only: not amiss‚ because they
substitute the name of Bethsaida for the other z—but they
do not well agree about the situation of both. Julias-Be-
tharamphtha was seated at the very influx of Jordan into the
lake of Gennesaret. For thus J osephusd; “ Jordan, having
measured a hundred furlongs more from the lake Samocho-
nitiS‚ μετὰ πόλιν Ἰουλιάδα διεκτέμνει τὴν Γεννησὰρ μέσην, after
the city J ulias, cuts the lake of Gennesar in the middle.” Do
not these words argue that Jordan, being now ready to enter
into the lake, did first glide by Julias? To which those
things which are said elsewhere by the same author do
agree. “ Sylla (saith he e) encamped five furlongs from J ulias,
and stopped up the ways 3—namely, that which led to Cana,
and that which led to the castle Gamala. But I, when I un-
derstood this, sent two thousand armed men, under J eremias
their captain3 οἱ δὴ καὶ χάρακα θέντες ἀπὸ σταδίου τῆςἸουλιάδος
πλησίον τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ποταμοῦ· and they having encainped a
furlong from Julias near the river Jordan,'' &o Note that,
when they were distant from J ulias a surlong only, they are
but a little way off of Jordan. The maps place it more re-
mote from the influx of Jordan into the lake of Gennesaret
than these words will bear.
