the times of Adrian to the times of Constantine, was pro-
faned by the temple of Adonis: for the asserting of which
he cites these words of Paulinus: “ Hadrianus, supposing
that he should destroy the Christian faith by offering injury
to the place, in the place of the passion dedicated the image
of Jupiter, and profaned Beth-lehem with the temple of
Adonis :’' as also like words of Jerome: yet, he confesses,
the contrary seems to be in Origen against Celsus : and that
more true. For Adrian had no quarrel with the Christians,
and Christianity‚——but with the Jews, that cursedly rebelled
against him.

in the midst of the city. And when they saw any going

you are ambitious to be made a captain t, or a counsellorz'
but he answered‚ ⁶ There is no such thing in my mind.'--
‘ We hear of you, that you are about to sell your wealth.’
But he answered‚ ‘ Nor did this come into my mind.’ Thcn
