3:³0 Olcoroyraplzical Notes.

remembrance of the sun’s miraculous standing still by his
word. This is like them. Nor, indeed, is that of a much
better mould, which the Seventy add, ἐκεῖ ἔθηκαν uer* αὐ-
τοῦ εἰς τὸ μυῆμα, &c. “ There they put into the monument
with him the stone-knives‚ with which he circumcised the
children of Israel in Gilgal, when he brought them out of
Egypt, as the Lord had commanded them.'’ Were these,
think you, in the Hebrew text once, and have they slipped
out since? Do they not rather savour of the Samaritan
Gloss, or the J ewish tradition?

They recede from the Hebrew text in the same story, but
something more tolerably, when they render [723]ξὶ ἿζῐὲΖ ἶἿΒ-ξζῖᾖ
“ on the north side of the hill Gaash‚” Ἀπὸ Βορρᾶ τοῦ ὅρους
τοῦ Γαλαὰδ, “ from the north side of the hill Galaad ;” where,
as far as I am able to judge, they do not paraphrase ill,
though they do not render it to the letter. Let us consider
that obscure passage which hath so much vexed interpretem,
in Judges vii. 3; “ Proclaim now in the ears of the people‚

where this thing was acted was either in or very near the vale
of Jezreel,‚distant from mount Gilead beyond Jordan, twenty
or thirty miles; and therefore how could these Gideonites de—
part from mount Grilead? I am not ignorant what some do
allege towards the untying this knot, viz. that it should be
taken thus, “ Whoever be of mount Quoad, let them return.”
The Targumist to this sense ς “ W hosoever is fearful, let him
return, ἾΞῖζῖλἻ &numo ἾΠΞΠἾῚ (md let choica be made out of
mount θ’ἱῖθαίίς i. e. ‘ Let the Gileadites be chosen.’ But
whether his meaning was that the Gileadites should be chosen
to remain because they are not afraid, or be chosen to re-
turn because they were; Ι shall not reckon it worth the while
to inquire.

But may not mount Gilead in this place be understood
of the hill Gaash3⁸ It is certain the situation agrees well
enough; and perhaps there is no great difference in the
name.

Whence that mount Gilead beyond Jordan first had its
name, is not unknown; namely, from that lteap qf stmzes,
