Rabbi Ismail saith X, ΞΠ min& ἿἾἾᾸ ΕἾΠἾΞ “ that the Ou-
thites are proselytes of lions.'’ R. Akiba saith, ῙΠ Dm& ’nu
“ that they are true proselytes.‘'' The story of the lions,
2 Kings xvii. 26, is well enough known; which Josephus Y,
faltering very lamely, reports in this manner3 Ἕκαστοι κατὰ
ἔθνος ἴδιον Θεὸν εἰς τὴν Σαμάρειαν κομίσαντες, πέντε δ’ ἦσαν, καὶ
τούτοις, καθὼς ἣν πάτριον αὐτοῖς, σεβόμενοι, παροξύνουσι τὸν με’-
γιστον Θεὸν εἰς ὀργὴν καὶ χόλον. Λοιμὸς γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἐνέσκεψεν,
ὑφ’ οὗ φθειρόμενοι, ὣο. He tells us that as every one brought
their several gods into Samaria, and worshipped them ac-
cordingly, so the great and true God was infinitely displeased
with them, and brought a destructive plague amongst them.
He makes no mention of lions being sent amongst them,
according to what the sacred history relates. Probably the
story of that horrible destruction upon Sennacherib's army
by a wasting plague, gave the first rise to -Josephus’s fancy of
. a plague amongst the Samaritans ς though it is very odd that
he should have no touch of the lions, being so remarkable a
judgment as that was.

3. ›S‘amarz‘a planted willa colom'es two several times.

There are the colonies which Asnapper is said to have
brought into Samaria, Ezra iv. 10, as well as those by Esar-
haddon, ver. 2.

The Jews do judgez this ‘ Asnapper’ to be the same with
⁶ Sennacherib,' and that he had eight names. The first syl-
lables of the names, indeed, agree pretty well, Sena and Asna3
but whether they denote the same persons, Ι leave undeter-
mined.

However a, whether this Asnapper was the same with Sen-
nacherib, or Shalmaneser‚ or some great minister, or the
king's eommander-in-chief³ in the transplanting of a colony,
it seems evident that Samaria was planted with colonies two
