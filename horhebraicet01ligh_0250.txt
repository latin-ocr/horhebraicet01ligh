Tiberias stood touching on the sea; ‘⁶ forz on one side it
had the sea for a wall.''

‘⁶ Gennesaret was a place near Tiberias, where were gar-
dens and pa1·adises.” They are the words of the Aruch.

Capernaum we place within the country of Gennesaret
upon the credit of the evangelistS‚ Mat-t. xiv. 34, and Mark
vi. 53, compared with John vi. 22, 24.

Tariohaa was distant from Tiberias thirty furlongsb: Beth-
maus, four furlongs.

Magdala was beyond Jordan3 for it is called ³72 ‘7720
fllagyclala of Gadara .· and that which is said by the Talmud-
ists, ‘¹ TheC Gadarenes might„ by the permission of R. J uda
Nasi, come down to Ohammath on the sabbath, and walk
through it, unto the furthest street, even to the bridge‚’' is
expressed and expounded by them in the same place, “ That
the people of Magdala, by the permission of R. Judah Nasi,
went up to Chammath‚” &c. From which single tradition
one may infer, 1, That Magdala was on the bank of Gadara.
2. That it was not distant from Uhammath above a sabbath-
day's journey. 3. Thai: it was on that side of Chammath‚
which was built on the same bank of Gadara by which it
reached to the bridge above Jordan, which joined it to the
other side on the bank of Galilee.

“ Hippod wase distant from Tiberias thirty furlongS.”
With which measure compare these words, which are spoken
of Susitha; which that it was the same with Hippo, both
the derivation of the words and other things do evince:

“ R. Juda saith, Thef monoceros entered not into Noah’s
ark, but his whelps entered. R. Nehemiah saith, N either he
nor his whelps entered, but N oah tied him to the ark. U'UW
