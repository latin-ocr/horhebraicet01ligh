The Lake Smnochonitis. 141

OHAP. LXIX.

The lake Sawzoclconitz's [or Semeelaom'tvis]

IN the Holy Scriptures it is the ‘ W ater of Merom‚'
J osh. xi. 5. In the Babylonian Talmudists it is ³:207 ΠῸἾ
‘ The Sibbechean sea.' Hence is that, “ J ordane ariseth out
of the cave of Paneas, and flows into the Sibbechean sea.’'
In the Jerusalem Talmudists, sometimes it is ³2:³27 &72³
‘ The sea of Gobebo,' as we have noted before3 and sometimes
'nmo-r Nm* ‘ The sea of Samaco 3' whence in other languages
it is ‘ Saniachonitis!

Τῇ f Σεμεχωνιτῶν λίμνῃ τριάκοντα μὲν εὖρος, ἑξήκοντα δὲ μῆκος
στάδια. Διατείνει δὲ αὐτῆς τὰ ἕλη μέχρι Δάφνης χωρίου· “ The
lake Semechonitis is thirty furlongs in breadth, and sixty in
length. The fens of it are stretched out unto the country
Daphne; a country, as it is otherwise pleasant, so containing
fountains: αἳ, τρέφουσαι τὸν μικρὸν καλούμενον Ἰορδάνην ὑπὸ
τὸν τῆς χρυσῆς βοὸς νεὼν, προσπέμπουσι τῷ μεγάλῳ.” The
scruple lies concerning the pointing of ὑπὸ τὸν τῆς χρυσῆς βοὸς
νεών. The sentence and sense seems indeed to flow more
smoothly, if you should render it thus, ‘⁶ The springs which,
nourishing Little Jordan, as it is called, send it out into the
Great, under the temple of the golden calf :³⁶ but then a just
doubt ariseth of the situation of that temple. That· clause,
therefore, is rather to be referred to the foregfflng, so that
the sense may go thus; “The springs, which, nourishing
Little Jordan, as it is called, under the temple of the golden
calf, send it into the Great :²³ and so you have the temple of
the golden calf at the springs of Jordan, and the place ad-
jacent called Daphne, and the marshes of Samochonitis reach-
ing thither.

Theg Jerusalem Gemarists do thus explain those words of
Ezekiel, chap. xlvii. 8: ‘⁴' These waters go forth into the east
coast: wat> ³⁹:³17) 0³ ἾΠῗ tlcat is, into the lake Samoeleonitis.
And they shall go down into the plain3 that is, into the sea
of Tiberias. And they shall go out into the sea3 that is, into
the Dead Sea.”
