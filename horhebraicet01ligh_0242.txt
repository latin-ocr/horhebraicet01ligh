So also Luke: when, according to the order of the story, one
would think it should rather be said, εἰς Βηθανίαν καὶ Βηθ-
φαγὴ, ⁶ To Bethany and Bethphage.' For Christ, in his tra-
velling, came to Bethany‚ and there lodged, John xii. [1.]; and
from that city went forward by the space almost of a mile,
before he came as far as Bethphage. And yet it is named by
them in this order, ‘⁶ To Bethphage and Bethany ;''' that it
might be shewn that the story is to be understood of the
place where Bethany and Bethphage touch upon one another:
Matthew therefore names Bethphage alone.

We have elsewhere shewn more at large these two things
out of the T almudists‚ which ‹lo not a little tend to the
clearing of this matter:

I. That a tract, οι· one part of mount Olivet, was called
Bethany, not from the town of that name, where Lazarus*
dwelt, but the town was so called from that tract 3 and that
tract from the dates or palm trees growing there, ΤΠ Π“·3
Beth Herm {lae place afflatos.

ll. That there'was no town at all named Bethphage‚ but Ι
another tract ofOlivet was so called, for yram fiys growing
there3 that is the meaning of '⁴:152 ΓῬΞ Beth-phayi, ‘ The
place of green figs? und that the village, or outmost street
of Jerusalem, lying next it, was called by the same name.

We observed, also, that that place in mount Olivet, where
these two tracts Bethany and Bethphage touched on one
another, was a, sabbath-day's journey from the city, οι· there-
abouts. Which how it may be applied to illustrate the pre-
sent basisess we are upon, let us say a few things concerning
such a journey.

How far the bounds of a sabbath-(lays journey reached,
every one knows: and every one knows that that space was
measured out every way without the citios, that the certain
bounds might be fixed„ and that there might be no mistake;
and that, by some evidont mark, the lilnits might be known⁷
that they {night not renmin doubtful in a thing wherein they
placed so niuch religion.

These :tre the rules of the masters concerning measuring
two thousand cubits froin every side of the city:
