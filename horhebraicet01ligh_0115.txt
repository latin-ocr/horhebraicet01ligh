The cities of refuye. 105

O H A P. L. f
Of the cities of Refuqe.

HEBRON‚ the most eminent among them, excites us to
remember the rest. “ Τ heg Rabbins deliver this3 Moses
separated three cities of refuge beyond Jordan, [Deut. iv. 41,
42, 43 3] and, against them, J oshua separated three cities in
the land of Canaan, [Josh. xx. 7, 8.] And these were placed
by one another, just· as two ranks of vines are in a vineyard:
Hebron in Judea against Bezer in the wilderness: Shechem
in mount Ephraim against Ramoth in Gilead: Kedesh in
mount Napthali against Golan in Basan. And these three
were so equally disposed, that there was so much space from
the south coast of the land of Israel to Hebron, as there was
from Hebron to Shechemg and as much from Hebron to
Shechem, as from Shechem to Kedesh; and as much from
Shechem to Kedesh‚ as from Kedesh to the north coast of
the land.''

Ith was the Sanhedrim's business to make the ways to
those cities convenient, by enlarging them, and by removing
every stop, against which one might either stumble or dash
his foot. No hillock or river was allowed to be in the way,
over which there was not a bridge: and the way, leading
thither, was, at least, two-and-thirty cubits broad. And in
every double way, or in the parting of the ways, was written

ωἷῇρῃ, ΐῶἶῗξῖἵ) “Refuga refuge, ''——lest he that fied thither
might mistake the way.

Thei mothers of the high-priest used to feed and clothe
those, that for murder were shut up in the cities of refuge,
that they might not pray for the death of their sons‚—since
the fugitive was to be restored to his country and friends at
the death of the high-priest: but if he died before in the city
of refuge, his bones were to be restored after the death of the
high-priest.

Thek Jews dream ¹, that in the days of the Messias, three
other cities are to be added to those six which are mentioned
