read in Middoth: “ Inb the railed place’' [that divided the
chel from the court of the Gentiles] ’13Ἶὲζῦ Ἡ ῬΠ msam 'a

made upon it, &c. And that of the impudent woman3
‘⁴ Mary0‚ the daughter of Bilgah, apostatized, and married
a certain Greek soldier. She came, and struck upon the top
of the altar, crying out, ῠἾρἹῙῚ ῠἾρἹῖἳ O wolf, wolf! thou
that devourest the wealth of Israel ς and yet in the time of
her extremity canst not help her.'' The same things are told
of Titusd.

Bute the heaviest thing of all was, when Antiochus pro-
faned the Temple and the altar, nor would allow any sacri-
fices to be offered there but heathenish and idolatrous. Of
which persecution consult 1 Maec. i. and Josephus, Antiq.
lib. xii. cap. 7. [xii. 5.] Indeed, this waste and profanation of
sacred things lasting for three years and a half, so stuck in
the stomachs of the Jews, that they retained that very
number as famous and remarkable 3 insomuch that they often
make use of it when they would express any thing very sad
and afflictive.

“Theref came one from Athens to Jerusalem, and stayed
there three years and a half, to have learnt the language of
wisdom, but could not learn it. Vespasiang besieged Jeru-
salem for three years and a half; and with him were the
princes of Arabia, Africa, Alexandria, and Palestine, Sco.
Threeh years and a half did Hadrian besiege Betar. Thei
judgment of the generation of the deluge was twelve months :
the judgment of the Egyptians twelve months : the judgment
of J ob was twelve months: the judgment of Gog and Magog
was twelve months: the judgment of the wicked in hell
twelve months. But the judgment of Nebuchadnezzar was
three years and a half ε and the judgment of Vespasian ”three
years and a half. Nebuchadnezzark stayed in Daphne of
Antioch, and sent Nebuzar-adan to destroy Jerusalem. He
continued there for three years and a half.”
