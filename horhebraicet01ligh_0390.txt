Talmudists for tl1e”dates of palm-trees, that never come 10
111611· full maturity: :hyn tumn ΓΌ Α sort qf illpalm-trees,
as the Gloss in Beraoothl ; “ the fruit of 1116 palm 111111 never
ripens.” So Aruch in me: Caphnitlc. By a signification
near akin 10 ἾΓΠ Hane, and *prm Aheno, which denotes the
unripe dales os palms3 from whence, I suppose, Bethany, in
1116 mount of Olives, is derived. So 111111 some. outmost part
of the city and wall towards mount Olivet was called Beth-
plzccye from 1116 fiys that grew there, and another part of it
Cleaplcenatlza from the dates.

Every word almost in this place must. be considered 3 118,
indeed, almost every word of it is obscure.

Ι. Diuum T aures :] This, indeed, is 1101 so obscure, but
