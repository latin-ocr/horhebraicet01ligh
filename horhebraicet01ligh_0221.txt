THE word ἔρημος, wilclerness, stops us in a wilderoess, if it is
of so various and doubtful signification.

1. Sometimes it denotes only the fields, or the country
in opposition to the cit-y3 which we observed at Matt. iii. 1:

wilderness' by ‘the country Seah,' when it might be ren-
dered, and perhaps ought, ‘ the Seah which the Israelites
used when they encamped in the wilderness,’ let him, if he
please, take another example for it.
