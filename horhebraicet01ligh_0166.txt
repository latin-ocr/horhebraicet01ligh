And elsewhere⁵‚ where it is disputed‚ what is the more
noble part of food, something seasoned with salt, or a morsel‚
—and it is concluded, that that which is seasoned is to be
preferred, and that thanks are to be given upon it3 the men-

which is also called Ohinnereth, abounded with noble gardens,
they made certain shady bowers, or small tents, for that time,
wherein they gathered the fruits.”
