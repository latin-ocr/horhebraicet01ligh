Πῇπῃρζῃ Shikmonalc the name of a place, among the 'Pal-
mudists, seemed to design that town. ὒγἺΠ ΓἾἾὯΞ ΓὈἾἺΓΤ ¹72

is the name of a place.'

Since the whole land of Samaria, lay between Judea and
Galilee‚ it is no wonder if there were some difference both
of manners and dialect between the inhabitants of those
countrieS. Ooncerning which, see the eighty-sixti} and the
eighty-seventh chapters.

Διακόσιαιθ καὶ τέσσαρες κατὰ τὴν Γαλιλαίαν εἰσὶ πόλεις καὶ
κώμαι. “ There are two hundred and four cities and towns in
Galilee :”——which is to be understood of those that are more
eminent and fortified.

Ind nether Galilee, those, among others, were fortified by
Josephus,—.Jotopata‚ Beersabee, Salamis, PareochQ Japha,
Sigo, Mount Itaburion, Taricheee, Tiberias

In upper Galilee, the rock Achambom Seph, Jamnith,
Mero. More wi-ll occur to us as we go on.

καὶ Σκυθόπολις, μέχρι τῶν Ἰορδάνου ῥείθρων· “on the south,
Samaris and Scythopolis, unto the flood of J ordan.”

Scythopolis is the same with Beth-shenn, of which is no
seldom mention in the Holy Scriptul·eS‚ Josh. xvii. 11, Judg. i.
27, 1 Sam. xxxi. 10. Βεθσάνη καλουμένη πρὸς Ἑλλήνων Σκυθό-
πολιςε “ Bethsane (saith Josephusg), called by the Greeks
Scythopolis.'' It was distant but a little way from Jordan,
seated in the entrance to a great valley: for so the same
author writes, Διαβάντες δὲ τὸν Ἰορδάνην, ἧκον εἰς τὸ Μέγα
πεδίον, οὗ κεῖται κατὰ πρόσωπον πόλις Βεθσάνη, 810. “ Having
passed Jordan, they came to a great plain, where lies before
you the city Bethsane‚” &a
