THERE was a tradition ancl national custom famous among
them, concerning which we have mention somewhere, ΞἾΞ

a vineyard of four years old, should go up to Jerusalem in a
day's journey on every side.'’ The sense of the tradition is
this; the second tithes were either to be eaten at Jerusalem,
or, being sold at home, the money was to be brought to Jeru-
salem, whence some things were bought to be caten there.

vineyards which were within a diet of the city, should not be
sold, but that they should be brought to Jerusalem and caten

placesS noted in tho margin, reads pes-*1 ΓΞ ΓιίῬΝ “ Elath

in what sense, these words agree, connnentators endeavour to
resolve obscurely cnough3 bnt it is not of so much moment
to detain us.

Elath recalls to my mind some things which are spoken by
the Notitia of the eastern empirc. Whem, “ under the dis-
position of the honourable inan, the ‹lnkc of Palestine‚” is
substituted, among others, ‘⁶ l‘rwfectus legionis dcoimae Fre-
