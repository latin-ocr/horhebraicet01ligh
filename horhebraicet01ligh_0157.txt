Tiberias. 1 47

lon), they lament him there (at Tiberias) after this manner,
The hearsc of a famous man deceased in Sheshach (Babylon>:
whose name also is of note in Rakkath‚ is brought hither:
thus lament ye him‚—O ye lovers of Israel, Ο citizens of Rak-
kath, come forth, and bewail the dead of Babylon! When
the soul of R. Zeira was at rest, thus one lamented him, The
land of Babylon conceived and brought forth delights, the
land of Israel nourished them. Rakkath said, XVoe to itself
because she lost the vessels of her delights. Therefore saith
Rabba, Chammath is the same with the warm baths of Gadar,
and Rakkath is Tiberias.'' ’

This city touched on the sea, so that the sea served on one
side for a wall to it. Hence is that, in the place but now
cited3 ‘⁶ Rabh Hezekiah read the Book of Esther in Tiberias,
on the sourteenth day (of the month Adar), and also on the
fifteenth day (see Esth. ix. 21), doubting whether it were
compassed with walls from the days of J oshua‚ or not. But
who would doubt this of Tiberias? when it is written, ⁴ And
the fenced cities were Ziddim, Zer, Chammath, Rakkath, and
Ohinnereth.' But it is clear to us that Rakkath is Tiberias.
The reason, therefore, why he doubted was this, because on
one side it was enclosed by the sea instead of a wall. But if
it were so, why did he doubt? Because, truly, it was no wall.
When the tradition is thus nr& ’ΠΨ &³7³ ΠὮἾΠ ³³7 ww&
2⁸10 Α city which, laath a walls, bnt not fortified walls, tlte
contiyuous lzouses are for sach walls. ΠὮἮ) ΝὝἾΞὩ ὩἾΞ
ΠΓῚὯἾΠ But Tiberias ‘is meapte-cl, which halla the sea for a wall.”
So also R. Simeon Ben J ochai‚ in the Jerusalem Gemara just
now alleged ε ‘ Among the cities fortified with walls Tiberias
is excepted, as having the sea for a wall.'

What fortune this city underwent under the name Rak-
kath, remains unknown. Herod the tetrarch put the name
os Tiberias upon it, and built the city, for the sake and me-
mory of Tiberius Gaesar, The etymology of which place while
the Gemarists deduce elsewhere, namely, either from mm
ΠἿΝἾ Τοό νεξχά, because it was fair to behold, or ΠἾἾΤὩΞΨ
“ because it was Βείὶὂοναῖι, in tlce maeel, or middle? &c they
seem rather to sport out of a luxuriant wit, than to bc igno-
rant of the thing itself.
