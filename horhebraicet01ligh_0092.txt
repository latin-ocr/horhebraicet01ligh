The A1·uch;—“ The wall of Bethphage is the wall of J eru-
salem.’'

Now consult the maps and the commentaries of Christ-
ians, and you have Bethphage seated far from the walls of
the city: not very far from the top of mount Olivet: where,
also, the footsteps of it (even at this day) are falsely shown
to travellers. So our countrynian Sandys¹¹‚ an eyewitness‚
writes concerning it : ‘⁵ We now ascend mount Olivet (saith ¹<
he), another way bending more northwards'' (for before, he
had described the ascent to Bethany). “ On the right hand,
not far from the top, was Bethphage seated, whose very foun-
dations are confounded 3 from whence Christ, sitting upon
the soal of an ass, went in triumph to Jerusalem: the father-
guardian every ⁴Palm Sunday now superstitiously imitating

They took their resolutions concerning the situation of
this place not elsewhere certainly than from the gospel his-
tory, which seems openly to delineate Bethphage at the
mount Olivet. True, insleedg and yet nothing hinders, but
we may believe the Jews, asserting it to be within the walls
of Jerusalem, since they illustrate the thing with so many
examples 3 nor is there any reason, why they should either
feign or dissemble any thing in this matter.

To the deterlnining, therefore, of the business, we must
have recourse, first, to the derivation of the word: Beth-
phage is rendered by some a ⁶ house or place of a sountain:
from the Greek Πηγὴ, “ afountain :'’ but this is something
hard : by the Glosser in Bava Mezia, in the place last cited,
it is rendered, a paved ‘ causeway ς’ “ The outmost compass
of Jerusalem (saith he), which they added to it, is called Beth-
phage, and seems to me to ‹lenote a beaten 1( α J To which
