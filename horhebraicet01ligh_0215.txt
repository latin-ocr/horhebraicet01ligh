laid wait for him, but he was slain and buried at the moun-

Those words of Moses do rack interpretem, Exod. xvii. 16 :
T‘QHD? ³7³] '12 Jacl Al Cas-yell. The Seventy render it,
Ἐν χειρὶ κρυφαίᾳ πολεμεῖ Κύριος, “ The Lord wars with a se-
cret hand.’' All other versions almost render it to this sense,
“ The hand upon the throne of the L01·d.'' So the Sama-
ritan, Syrian, Arabio, Vulgar, and the RabbinS,—-that is,
‘ God hath sworn.’

What if HJD? Casff'ah be Casiotis? For that country was
the country of the Edoniites, but especially os the Ama-
lekites‚ concerning whom Moses treats in that history. We
will not too boldly depart from the common consent of all,
and we do modestly and humbly propound this conjecture:
which if it may take any place, the words may there be ren-
dered, without any scruple or knot, to this sense, “ The hand
of the Lord is against Cassiotis‚” (the country of the Ama-
lekites3 for) ‘⁶ the Lord hath war with Ainalek from genera-
tion to generation.”

Smer. IV.—Rhinocor202·a. The Arabio Interpreter noted.

WE are now come to the river Sichor ; called ‘ the river of
Egypt? not because it was within the Egyptian territories‚
but because it was the J ews' limits towards Egypt. There,
heretofore‚ was ⁴ Rhinocoruraff Whence the Seventy‚ in Isa.
xxvii. 12, render ΒξἾ-ζζῃ ‘my-¹32 ‘⁶ Unto the river of Egypt‚'⁷
Ἕως Ῥινοκορούρων, ‘3 Unto the Rhinocoruri.” 1 suppose
the Arabio interpreter imitated them, and writ first nini:
Coruum but that at last a little pointn crept in into the
last letter, and so it was changed from r into φῖ. So that
now we read ἸἾὈ, which is sounded Coronis, in the Latin
interpreter.

SEcr. V.⁰— Tlce country of the Avites .· a part of the
new [dumea.

PAssmG the river, we enter into new Idumea, anciently the
region of the Avites; in the Holy Scripture called Hazerini.
