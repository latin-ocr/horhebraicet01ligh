Perea. 295

But if the name should be writ in the mother tongue‚ rr:
15:³3 Beth Zemm, it might signify α place or reqion ofcold ,-
and so denote some country adjacent to the snows of Leba-
non; or some part of ΝᾸῘἋἾ Um the mountain qs snow [Her-
mon]; I rather believe.

Smer. II.— W bether Perea may not also be called Galilee.

I. ALTHOUGH the whole Transjordanine country might
justly enough be called Περαία, Perea, for this very reason,
because it was πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, on the other side Jor-
dan; yet, generally speaking, the country is distinguished,
and that is peculiarly called Perea, which was the kingdom
of Sehon, the dwelling afterwardi of the Reubenites, and
part of the tribe of Gad.

Hence that of Ptolemy, that ἀπ’ ἀνατολῶν τοῦ ποταμοῦ ’lop-
δάνου, “ from the east of the river J ordan,'’ there are only
these cities reckoned up by him:

Κόσμος, C'osmos.

Λιβίας, Livias.

Καλλιρροῆ, Callirrhoe. Of old, Lasha.
Γάζωρος, Gazorus.

Ἐπίκαιρος, Epiccerzcs.

Other places that were beyond Jordan he mentions under
other districts; as, some under Coelosyria‚ others under
Batanea.

That which we are now inquiring about, is, whether the
Transjordanine country was ever called Galilee. The riso
of this question is, because our Evangelist mentions the whole
tetrarchy of Herod, under the name of Galilee, when as Perea
was a great part of it. 1 incline much to the affirmative, for
these reasons: and first, I suppose that the upper part of
the country ‘ beyond J ordan’ might be called ⁶ Galilee.'

l. From Matt. iv. 15, ὁδὸν θαλάσσης πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου,
Γαλιλαία τῶν ἐθνῶν, “ by the way of the sea beyond Jordan,
Galilee of the Gentiles.'' Are not those places beyond tho
sea of Gennesaret, called, in this place, ‘ Galilee of the Gren-
tiles,' in distinction to Galilee properly so called, on this side
Jordan?
