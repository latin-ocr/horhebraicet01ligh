Repkaim-. 285

not whence the word Asia may more fitly be derived, than
from the memory of this gigantie raee, living almost in the
middle of Asia, and monstrous and astonishing above all other
Asiaties. The LXX eall them Τιτάνας, Titans, 2 Sam. v. 1 8, 22.
The word used by the Samaritam denotes Physicians e, and
so it is rendered by me in the Polyglott Bible, lately pub-
lished at London, Dent. ii, partly, thala it might be rendered
word for word, but especially, that it might be observed by
what sound, and in what kind of pronunciation he read t-he
word ΒἾΝΞἾ Bephaim. So the LXX render it ’lav-pol,
Physidans, Isa. xxvi. 14, διο.

ι e. [From κῃ, sanavit. In the same sense non is used in Chaldee
and Syriae]
