two pates of Huldalc k. At which gates 1 rather admire than
believe or understand what I meet with concerning them3
“ Beh01d1, he stands behind our wall, that is, behind the west
wall of the Temple 3 because the Holy Blessed One hath sworn
that it shall never be destroyed. U‘ffiffi’! ‘ww 3³3³ ἾὩΨἸ
ΕΒἾὩΒ ἸΞἾΠ &³7 The Priest's flate also, cmd Huldalo's grate,
were never to be destroyed till God shall renew them.''

What gate that of tlze priest's should be, Iam absolutely
ignorant; unless it should be that over which was 55:127ss
ΝἾὩἾἾῘῬἸΞ “ 1116 conclave of the βουλευτῶν, the counsellors,”
where was the bench and the consistory of the priests.

But be it this, or be it that, how do these and the rest
agree with what J osephus relateth ἓ

“ Caesarm commanded that- the whole city and Temple
should be destroyed, saving only those towers which were
above the rest; viz. Phasaelus‚ the Hippio, and Mariamne‚
and the west wall. The wall, that it might be for 1116 gar-
rison soldiers 3 the 10111616, as a testimony how large and how
fortified a city the Roman valour had subdued. Τὸν δ’ ἄλλον
ἅπαντα τῆς πόλεως περίβολον οὕτως ἐξωμάλισαν οῖ κατασκάπτου-
res, ὡς μηδὲ πώποτ’ οἰκηθῆναι πίστιν ἂν ἔτι παρασχεῖν τοῖς προσ-
ελθοῦσι· “ But as to all 1116 1661 of the city and its whole com-
pass, they so defaced and demolished it, that posterity or
strangers will hardly believe there was ever any inhabited
city there.'’ thich all agrees well enough with what we
frequently meet with in the Jewish writers3 that Turnus
Rufus drew a plough over the city and Temple. He is called
in J osephus Terentius Rufus, ’Ἄρχων τῆς στρατιᾶς ¹¹.

Tfflzouon the ‘ Grate of Huldah' you enter into the Oourt of
the Gentiles, and that under the Στοὰ Βασιλικὴ, {lae Kc'ny's
Gallergs3 which, from the name itself and gallantncss of the
structure, might seem worthy of such a founder as Solomon.
But this is not the porch or gallery which we seck for, nor
had it 1110 name of νομαί from king Solonion, but from king

Herod.
