370 Oboroqraphical inquiry.

Josephus, in this inquiry of ours, will lead us elsewhere;

· who thus tells us 0, ’Ήδη δὲ τότε καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν ἐτετέλεστο, “ At

this time was the Temple finished'' [i. e. under Gessius Flo-
rus, the procurator of J udea about the eleventh or twelfth
year of Nero]; “ the people, therefore, seeing the workmen
were at leisure'' [the work of- the Temple being now wholly
finished], “ being in number more than eighteen thousand,
importune the king” [Agrippa] τὴν ἀνατολικὴν στοὰν ἀνεγεῖραι,
“ that he would repair the eastern porch.'' Here are some
things not unworthy our observation 3 partly, that the Temple
itself was not finished till this time; and then, that the eastern
porch was neither then finished, nor, indeed, was there any at
all; for Agrippa, considering both how great a sum of money,
and how long a space of time would be requisite for so great a
work, rejected their suit. Herod, as it should seem from?
J osephus, finished the Temple, and the Pronaon, tlte porch
before it, and the Στοὰν Βασιλικὴι·, me Royal Gctllery. But
what he finished further, about the courts and cloister-walks,
it does not appear. It is manifest, indeed, that there was a
great‘l deal left unperfected by him; when the whole was
not finished till the very latter end of Nero’s reign, and
scarcely before that fatal war in which the Temple was burnt
and buried in its own ruins : which observation will be of use
when we come to John ii. 20, “ Forty and six years was this
Temple in building.'’

J osephus proceeds, as to the eastern gallery: ‘''Hv δὲ ἡ στοὰ
τοῦ μὲν ἔξωθεν ἱεροῦ· Now that was {lm 9allery οἵ the outward
Temple, overlooking a deep valley, supported by walls of four
hundred cubits, made of great square stone, very white : the
length of each stone was twenty cubits⁷ and the breadth six.
''Epyov Σολομῶνος τοῦ Βασιλέως πρώτου δειμαμένου τὸ σύμπαν
ἱερόν· “ The work of king Solonion, who first founded the whole
Temple.” There needs no commentary upon these words; the
ἀνατολικὴ στοὰ, the east qallery was first ἔργον Σολομῶνος,
Solomon’s work .· which plainly points which and where was
Solomon's Porch3 namely‚ upon the outer wall of the Temple,

towards the east, as (lte Royczl Gallery was upon the south
wall.
