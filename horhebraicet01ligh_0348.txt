they will pretend to some Samaritam kingdom): and if so,
it is as obvious whom they design by “ Ben Nezer.” Let

HAva spoken of Nazareth, it will not be amiss to make
some mention of Oapernaum, which, however distant many
miles, yet was it the place where our Saviour dwelt, as Na-
zareth was his native soil. We have considered its situation
in another treatise, being in the country of Gennesaret, a

from D'lruz the former donotes pleasantness ,· the latter,
