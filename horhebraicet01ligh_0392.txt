Let me conclude the whole with a conjecture something
extravagant‚ which the mention of Lebanon gives rise to. I
suspect our Europe did first derive its name from colel ; as
that mountain did, from the snows. The phoeniciam, sailing
to Hercules’s Pillars (of which see the learned Bochart), had,
on their left hand, the land of ΕΠ Olcam, laeat or burninfy, i. e.
Africa: on the right hand, the land of ῆἾἾΠ Chorepk, winter
or colel, especially compared with the other's heat, from which
word Chorepk, probably, our word Europe takes its original.
That very learned man derives it otherwise3 and let him enjoy
his sense, whilst l beg leave to enjoy my conjecture.
