318 Oleorogrraphe'cal Notes.

the dispute is, whether they were Levites or IsraeliteS‚ par-
ticularly natives of Emmaus, the natives of those two families,
who, for their purity, were thought worthy to be taken into
the affinity and blood of the priests themselves. And this
passage, indeed, puts it out of all question, that Emmaus
was not within the tribe of Ephraim3 because it would be
ridiculous to suppose that either Samaritan women should
be joined in marriage with the priests, or that Samaritan
men should be permitted to play on the instruments in the
Temple. Emmaus, therefore, must be placed in the tribe of
Benjamin‚ which what it was called before is not easy to
guess.

l conceive there is mention made of this place in Siphrae:
“ R. Akibah said3 1 asked Rabban Gamaliel and R. Joshua
ΦἾΝὩΝ ΒΨ Dlvmbm in tlze slzamhles of Emmazm, when they
went to receive the beust to make a feast, for their son‚’' &a
Now Rabban Gamaliel and R. J oshua were both of Jabneh;
so that, by considering the situation of J abneh, we may more
confidently believe that they were in the Emmaus we are
speaking of. We have the same passage in Maccoth‚ fol.
¹4· 1.

It was one of the larger cities: for so J osephus speaks of
it; Kaif τέσσαρας πόλεις ἐξαυδραποδίζεται Κάσσιος, ὧν ἦσαν αἱ
δυνατώταται Γόφνα τε καὶ Ἐμμαοῦς, πρὸς ταύταις δὲ Λύδδα καὶ
Θαμυά· “ Cassius disfranchized four cities‚ the greatest of
which was Gophna and Emmaus, and next to these was
Lydda and 'l'hamnass’

Underg the disposition of the dukc of palestine amongst
the rest, was “ Ala Antala of the dromedarios of Admatha ;”
where Pancirole notes, that Admatha in St. Jerome, in his
Hebrew Places, is called ⁶ Ammata.' This, by the agreeable-
ness of sound, may seem to bc our Emmaus3 unless, more pro-
bably, at this time it bore the name of Nicopolis.

NVhen I take notice that Oleammatles ΠὮΠ or the ‘ Baths
of T iberias,' are commonly in thc Greek rendered Ἀμμαοῦς,
and withal, that our Ennnaus was much celebrated sor famous
waters; I cannot sorget the · watcrs of Nephtoah,y or the
‘ Fountain os Etann’ from whence water was convcyed by
