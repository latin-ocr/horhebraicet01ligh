stood of one of the chambe-rs of which we have spoken: which
sense the Arabio interpreter seems 10 follow; who renders it,
that “ Jesus sat «τοὶ-3 ⁴:0⁴1: at the yate of the treasury.’' But
when it is said that he spake those words ἐν τῷ γαζοφυ-
λακίῳ, in 1116 treasurgs, those chambers are wholly excluded‚
into which 11 would be ridiculous to think that they permitted
Christ 10 enter.

But 11016, the word Γαζοφυλακιώυ, traesuries, in Josephus,
is 1116 plural number, and that he speaks of the court of the
women, and you will be past doubting that he respected these
chests under the word treasuries: and you will doubt as
little that Mark looked the same way when you shall have
observed that his speech is of 1116 woman, how both she and
others cast, money εἷς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον, into the treaszcry;
which, as appears from 111066 things we have produced out of
the Talmudists, was neither customary, nor allowed 10 (10 11110
other Corbans.

This court„ indeed, is commonly called 111 1116 J ewish writers,
[NH] ΠὙςΞ] the court of the wemma,- 1101 that women only
entered in there, but because women 1nigh¹0 1101 go further3
in 1116 samo sense as the outward 601111, 16 called ‘the court
of 1116 Gentiles,7 1101 than heathens only might, enter there,
but because they might. 1101 go further. That court was also
most ordinarily called ΠῚᾘΠ ἾΠ the filomelam of the Temple ,·
60 11116 also whereof we are treating was called Γαζοφυλάκιον,
the tmasury.

WVhem therefore, it 16 said by St.Ma11k that Jesus sat>
κατέυαυτι τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου, over-ayaiwst the treasury, it
coines 10 this, that 116 sat under 1116 walk before which
those 6116616 were placed. And when John saith, ‘⁶ Jesus
spalze these words in the t1·easury‚” 11 16 all one as if he had
said, ⁶ He spake these words in the court of 1116 women ;’
yea, in that place where those chests were, that that plac-e
might, be distinguished from others which were in 111111 coum
for 111 every corner of that court there was a little court, each
one called by 116 011111 name, as appears in 1116 places written
111 1116 margink.
