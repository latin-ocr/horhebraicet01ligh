You see the Antiochian and Syrophoenician Syria pos-
sessed by the Canaanites3 and yet we are not come as far as
the land of canaan.

Let us therefore proceed onwards with Canaan and the
rest of his sons. The borders of the OanaaniteS, saith the
Holy Scripture, ‘⁶ were from Sidon to Gerar, even unto Gaza,'’
Gen. x. 19. You will say they were from Antioch, and
utmost Phoenicia, and a great part of Syria. True‚ indeed,
those eountries, as we have seen, were planted by the sons of
canaan, but the Scripture doth not eall them Oanaanites ς
but where their coasts end towards the south, there the
Oanaanites' begin. The tract therefore, or region first pos-
sessed by them, is called by a peculiar name Canacm, as dis-
tinet from the rest of the land of Canaan, J udg. iv. 2 3 where
“ Jabin the king of Hazor” is called ‘⁶ the king of Oanaan,”
that is, of the northern coast of the land of Canaan. And

, among the seven nations devoted by God himself to a curse

and cutting-off, the Canaanites are always numbered, when
all indeed were Ganaanites: and that, as it seems, upon a
double rcason; partly, because that country was distinetly
so called, as another country, and was of a peculial* differ-
