Thus the Latin version of him:

Caesarea Stratonis ........... 66. 15.
J oppa ............... 65. 4ο.
Jamnetorum portus. The haven of t-he J amnites . 65.

Gazaeorum portus. The haven of the Gazites . . 64. 45.

Gaza ............... 65. 26.
And more of the like variation.

Of the last, namely, of ‘ the haven of the Gazites,' and Gaza
itself, we may justly be at some stand. In Ptolemy himself,
as you see, ‘ the haven of the Gazites’ is in ξέ ς’ 65. 45. But
the Latin interpreter hath 64. 45 z-—nor indeed without reason,
when Gaza itself is only in 65. 26. But indeed, on the con-
trary, it is more probable that the haven of the Gazites
should be placed in 65. 26, and Gaza itself in 65. 45 3 where,
by the haven is by no means to be understood that place
where shipsy put in and unladed, but the whole bay, compre-
hended within the promontories that thrust themselves out
into the sea; the very last point of which thrusting forth
you may conceive to be in deg. 65. and 26: from the city
19 minutes.

If, therefore, you are minded to follow Ptolemy with this
alnendment, in measuring ont the breadth of the land be-
tween Gaza and Asphaltites, take it thus. Let Gaza be inZ
deg. 65. 45. And in him also, Ἀσφαλτίτιδος τὸ μέσον ἐπέχει
μοίρας ἕσς’ ν’. The Latin version is, ‘⁸ Asphaltitis medium
continet gradus 66. 50. The middle of Asphaltites contains
degrees 66. 50.” From Gaza, therefore, to the middle of the
Dead sea, will be a whole degree and έστ minutes 3 to which
65 miles, 5 minutes, do answer: whence if you withdraw the
half of the Asphaltites, there will remain 65 miles, or there-
abouts, from the shore of it to Gaza.

least shew that it wants rnending3 in whom we read thus;
