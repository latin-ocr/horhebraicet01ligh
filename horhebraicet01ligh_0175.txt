II. “ Townsb fortified from the days of J oshua: Old Ket-
sarah‚ which belongs to Tsipp01·; and Chakrah, which be-
longs to Gush; Calab3 and Jodapath the old [J otopata];
and Ganmlac,” 820. The Gloss is, “Ketsarah is the name
of a little city without Tsipporss'· Perhaps that which we
cited above relates to this, ΓἻἾΞΒ 4¹:⁸12> ΠἾἛρ ἾΞΞ “ The sons
of Ketzirah (or the harvest), of Tsippor.’'

ΙΙΙ. “ sometime-<1 a fire happened in the court of J osi Ben
Simai in Shihin, and the inhabitants of Ketsarah, which be-
longs to Tsippor, came down to quench it; but he permitted
them not, saying, ‘ Let the exactor exact his debt? Presently
a cloud gathered together above the fire3 and rains fell, and
put it out. The sabbath being finished, he sent money to
every one of them.''

J osephuse mentions also Γαρεισίμης, Garisimes, distant
twenty furlongs from Tsippor.

In like manner, Ἀσαμὼυ, τὸ μεσαίτατον Γαλιλαίας ὅρος, ὃ
κεῖται ἄντικρυς τῆς Σεπφώρεως· “ Asamonf, a mountain in the
middle of Galilee, which lies over against Tsippor.’'

“ ΤΗΕ11 Sanhedrim went ΞΏἻΞΨζῬ &unt-272³ &lffiNb ruffin
from Jabnek to Usha, aml from Usha {0 ›S'lzeplcm'aanzss' The
Gloss is, ‘⁶ To J abneh in the days of Rabban J ochanan (Ben
Zaceai); to Usha in the days os Rabban Gamaliel: but they
went back from Usha to J abneh: but in the days of Rabban
Simeon they returned.''

We do not apprehend the reason why Rabban Gamaliel
went thither3 whatsoever it were, either some disturbanee
raised by the Romans, or inclignation that R. Eleazer Ben
Azariah should be president with him, or some other reason,
—certainly the abode there was but small, either Gamaliel
himself returning to J abneh after some time, or R. Akibah, who
succecded in his chair.
