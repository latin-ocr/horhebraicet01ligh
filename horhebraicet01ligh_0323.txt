differing in some cireumstanees. ‘⁶ There ⁰ was another fight
betwixt the Galileans aud Samaritans3 κατὰ γὰρ τὴν Γήμαν κα-
λουμένην κώμηυ, ἥτις ἐν τῷ μεγάλῳ πεδίῳ κεῖται τῆς Σαμαρείτιδος·
For hard by a town called Gema, situated in the great plain
of Samaria, multitudes of Jews going up to the feast, there
was a cert-ain Galilean slain.’'

It is not much worth our examining whether this be one
and the same story with the other, or whether this Gema be
the same town with Nain: but this we may gather hence,
that Nain was in the extreme borders of Issachar, touohing
upon the Samaritan country, and Gema in the extreme
borders of Samaria that were next adjoining to Issaehar.
And when the Galileans went down from Nain, a town in
Issaehar, into the great plain of Samaria, the first town
in their way is Gema, there the enemy meets and fights
them: if at least Gema and Nain be not one and the same
place.

THERE is a great 111011111111011 111 1110 10 believe that Naim
is the same with Engannim, mentioned J osh. xix. 21, xxi. 29.
For, 1. Both of them were within the tribe of Issaehar3 En—
gannim, as the Holy Sersptures, and Nain, as the Jewish
doetors tell us3 and why we should not take their word in
such a thing as this, I know no reason. 2. Both of them
signify pleasantness: Naim‚ in the very etymon, implies plea-
santness: and Engannim‚ a somatain ofyardens. 3. The En-
gannim, mentioned Josh. xxi. 29, in 1 Chron. vi. 73, is 1333]

Anam. Now if you transpose the letters (as is done in 2·in
and ΟἾΠ) q, it will be 027: Naim. 4. Let me add that En-

gannim (if there be any eredit to those guides that commonly
shew these places to travellers) lies directly in the way going
from Galilee to Jerusalem; and 80, as is very evident, was
our Naim. Of this place, thus our countryman Biddulphp:
“ a town, commonly called J enine, of old Engannim : 01100011-
ingly pleasant, abounding with waters and gal-dens, and de-
lightsome walks.”
