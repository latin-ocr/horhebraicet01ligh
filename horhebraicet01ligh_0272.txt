upon them, the land of Israel shook four hundred parsae
every way.’'

ΠΞἻΞ g A parsa contains in it four miles. ‘³ Ten parsaeh
(saith the Gloss at the place in the margin) are forty miles :”
which might be proved largely elsewhere, if need were.
So that four hundred parsae (or so many thirty furlongs),
made a thousand six hundred miles. Which measure why
they ascribed it- to the land of Israel on every side of the
square of it, whether from the measurings of Ezekiel, or
from somcwhat else, we do not here inquire. But we can-
not bnt observe this, that the same number is mentioned,
and perhaps the same measure understood, Rev. xiv. 20:
“ Blood issued out of the lake to the horses' bridles, for a
thousand six hundred fu1·longs.” VVhere the Arabio reads,
&fflaessm ..jin Ala-ml ‘⁸ for the space of a thousand six hundred
miles.” .

The Tahnudists measure sometimes by miles, sometimes by
parses, sometimes by diets. Every one of these you will meet
with in them very frequently.
