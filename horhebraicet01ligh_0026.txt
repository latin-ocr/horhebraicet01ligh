ἿλΠ ΒΕἿΡὨΞ “Τ116 proselyte Aquila divided the inheritance
with his brother a Gentile‚ and devoted the use and benefit
of it to the salt sea. Of three doctors one saith, That he
devoted the moneys of idolatry into the salt sea.'’ Hence is
that allusion, Rev. xx. 14, “And death and hell were cast into
the lake of fire.''

It doth not please me, that Sodom, in the maps, is placed
in the northern bounds of the Asphaltites3 when it seems
rather to be placed in the southern extremity of it. For,

Ι. The bounds of the land are thus defined by Moses,
Gen. x. 19 : “The berders of the Oanaanites were from Sidon”
(on the north) “unto Gaza'' (on the south), “as thou goest
forward, 01· until thou comest to Sodom.'' Are not 1116
bounds here bent· from Gaza to 1116 farthest term opposite
10 11 011 1116 east?

II. J osephus t, in the description of the Asphaltites, which
we quoted a little above, hath these words: “ The length of it
is five hundred and eighty furlongs, καθὸ δὴ μέχρι Ζοάρων τῆς
Ἀραβίας ἐκτείυεταιε and it is stretched out as far as Zoar of
A1·abia.” Note, that the farthest coast of the extension of it
southward, is to Zoar. But now Zoar was not far distant
from Sodom, when Lot, with his company, got thither before
the rising of the sun, Gen. xix. 23. “ It is written (say the
Gemaristsu), ‘ The sun was risen upon the earth, when Lot
entered into Sodom.’- Now Sodom was four miles from
Zoar.''

The lnaps show you Zoar and Lot's Cave in «Judea, at the
northern coast almost of the Asphaltites z-—by what authority,
I do not apprehend. The Talmudists X, indeed, (10 mention a
certain Zoar, which they also call, “The Oity of l'alms.”—

to Zoar, the city of palms: and one of them foll sick, whom
