it before the Temple.’' Where the Gloss thus; “Zophim is
a place whence the Temple may be seen.” But another
Gloss doth not understand the thing here of that proper
place, but of the whole compass about the city, wheresoever
the city could first be seen. So R. Eliezer‚ of Abraham,
going from the south to Jerusalem, “Theu third day they
came to Zophim: but when he came to Zophim, he saw the
glory of the Divine Majesty sitting upon the Mount”
(Moriah).
OHAP. XLIII.x

Ramalz. Ramathaim Zoplcim. Gibeah.

THERE was a certain Ramah, in the tribe of Benjamin,
Josh. xviii. 25, and that within sight of Jerusalem, as it
seems, Judg. xix. ι 3; where it is named with Gibeah z—and
elsewhere, Hos. v. 8 ; which towns were not much distant.
See 1 Sam. xxii. 6; “ Saul sat in Gibeah. under a grove in
Ramah.’' Here the Gemaristsy trifle: “Whence is it (say
they) that Ramah is placed near Gibea? To hint to you, that
the speech of Samuel of Ramah was the cause, why Saul re-
mained two years and a half in Gibeah.” They blindly look
over Ramah in the tribe of Benjamin,-—ancl look only at
Ramah in Ephraim, where Samuel was born.

His native town is very often called Ramah, once Ra-
mathaim Zophim, 1 Sam. i. ι. “There was a certain man of
Ramathaim :⁹³ that is, one of the two Ramaths, which were
surnamed also ¹ Zophim.' A like form of speech is that
1 Sam. xviii. 213 ᾞ ἶΠΠΠΠ ῠῇζῐζῂῃ “ In one of the two,
thou shalt be my son-in-law.” That town of Samuel was
Ramath Zophim; and this of Benjamin, was Ramath Zophim
also: but by a different etymology, as it seems :—--that‚ it
may be, from Zuph, Saul's great-great-grandfather, whence
that country was so called, 1 Sam. ix. 5 ; this, from Zophim,
of which place wc have spoke in the foregoing chapter.

Gibeah was Saul's town. ΚώμηΖ ΓαβαΟ-Σαούλη καλουμένη.
