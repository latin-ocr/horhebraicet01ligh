The Oountrgs of Gennesar-et. 155

eludes, and saith, “ It is like to Beth-Mein, by which you
go down from Paltathah; but by which you go up from Ti-
berias.'' ⁴

In Josephush, Βηθμαοῦς ἀπέχουσα Τιβεριάδος στάδια τέσσαρας
“ Beth-Maus [Beth—Meon] is distant from Tiberias four fur-
longS.'' The maps place it too remote from thence.

II. There was also a place not far from Tiberias, or Mag-
dala, whose name was ΝἾἺΔἾΠ ἾΞΞ Caphar Clcittaia: which
we may guess at, from this story :—“ R. Simeoni Ben La-
chish said thus, They whip a prince, that offends, in the
sessions of the three men. R. Judah Nasi hearing these
words was angry, and sent to apprehend him. But he fied
without Magdala: but some say, Without Caphar Chittaia.”
—Ziddimk (J osh. xiX. 35) is Caphar Ohittaia. Zer is neigh-
bour to it.”

O H A P. LXXIX.l
Tlce country of Gennesaret.

J osEPHUs thus describes it ε “ Bym the lake Gennesar, is a
country extended, of the sanie name, of a wonderful nature
and pleasantness. For such is the fruitfulness of it, that it
denies no plant‚'’ 850. “ The temper of the air suits itself with
different fruits: so that here grow nuts, a more winter fruit;
there palms, which are nourished with heat3 and near them
figs and olives, which require a more moderate air‚'' Sec.

The Talmudists speak like things of the fertility and plea-
sure of this place.

“ Then Rabbins say‚Why is it called Gennesar? Because of
the gardens of princes (ΟἾἾΕ) ὊἎ). Those are the great men
who have gardens in that place. And it was of the lot of
Nephthali'’ (they are the words of the author of Aruch), “ as
it is said, ‘ And a thousand princes were of N ephthali.' ''

The fruits of Gennesaret arc mentioned as being of great
fame. “ Wherefore (say they0) are there not of the fruits of
Gennesaret at J erusale1n3 The reason is, that they who came
to the feasts should not say, We had not come but to eat the

fruits of Gennesaret.'’ ,⁴
