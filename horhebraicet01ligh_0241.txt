I cannot omit what he saith besides : ‘⁴ Much of the flesh
which was eaten at Jerusalem‚” in the time of the feasts,
‘ was of’' the second “ tithes. For scarce any one ‘carried
there unt-il he had eaten all his tithes3 but he gave the mo-
neys of the tithes either to the poor, or to his friends in the
city. And, for the most part, with the moneys of the tithes
they bought their thank-offerings.''

sat under the skadow of the Temple, and taught the people the
whole day.'’ The Gloss, “ When the Temple was a hundred
cubits high, it cast its shadow a great way in length, unto
that street which was before ΠἛΠ ἻΓἻ the filomelam of tlze
House. And because that street was spacious‚ and might
contain a great multitude of men, J ochanan taught there by
reason of the heat. For no synagogue could contain his
hearers.”

That street which was before the mount of the Temple,
according to the accustomed form cf speech, was that by
which they went to the Temple at the east gate; concerning
which street, and the people convened thither by Hezekiah,
mention is made 2 Chron. xxix. 4.<¹ This street went out
into the valley of Kedron, by the water-gata And this
way the priest went out, that was to burn the red cow in
Olivet. And this way our great High Priest entered with
palms and Hosanna. This was called “the Street of the
Temple‚'' Ezra x, 9.
