302 Choroyraplzical Notes.

itis, which we are now upon. Perhaps there might be some
part of Antilibanus called Hauran, either from the Syriae
word ἾἾἹΠ Havar, which signifies μήπω or from the Hebrew
word ἾἾΠ Hor, a cave. It may well enough agree either way,
the hill being white with snow, and hollow with, the subter-
raneam passayes that were there.

However, it is plain enough, from the place in Ezekiel
before quoted, that Hauran was situated in the very extreme
parts of the land towards the north, and from thence the
country, as it had its situation there, so had its name Aura-
nitis Gul. Tyriusb (by what authority Ι cannot tell) placeth
it near the sea of Gennesaret: “ Subito enim transcursa
regione Auraniffide, quae secus mare Tiberiadis est,'’ Sco.
“The country of Auranitis being suddenly run through,
which is by the sea of Tiberias,” 820.

And that the river Orontes [springing between Libanus
and Antilibanus near Heliopolis, as Plinyc hath it] took its
name from Hauran, the word itself seems to assure us. Al-
though some, quoted by Eustathius in Dionys. Περιηγ., do
apprehend it to be a Latin name. ’Ἄλλοι δὲ φάσιν (saith he)
ὅτι Καῖσαρ Τιβέριος ἐκ Δράκοντος αὐτὸν Ὀρόντην μετωνόμασεν,
ὃ σημαίνει Ἀνατολικόν· As if ‘ Orontes' were the same with
‘ Orientalis,' ‘the Eastern.’ But what that ἐκ Δράκοντος
should mean is a little difficult. Orontes was of old called

Typhon, as Strabod tells us.

S ECT. VL—Iturea.

THE reader must excuse me if I make a narrower search
into the situation of Iturea, although Barradius may confi-
dently enough have told him (upon his own trust merely, as
far as Ι can learn), that “ the country is in the tribe of N eph-
thali, at the foot of mount Libanus.'' Perhaps he hath fol-
lowed Borchard, who himself writes only upon the credit of
Jacobus de V itriaco: “ Scias regionem Decapolin quam va-
rie in Scripturis denominari,” &a “ You must knOW, the
region of Decapolis hath several names in Scripture. Some-
times it is called Iturea3 sometimes, Trachonitis3 sometimes,
the plain of Libanus; sometimes the land of Moab; in one
