withdrew himself, and fied.’'

GHAP. LVIII.
Antipatris. 0³sz ἾΞΣ, Caphar Salama.

WE find this town marked out heretofore by a double
name, if we believe some. 1. It is called Καφαρσαλαμᾶ by
some, of which mention is made by Josephusl, and the Book
of the Maccabees. 2. Χαφαρζαβᾶ by J osephus himself: Δεί-
σαςῐῃ δὲ Ἀλέξανδρος τὴν ἔφοδον αὐτοῦ [Ἀντιόχου Διονύσου]
τάφρον ὀρύττει βαθεῖαν, ἀπὸ τῆς Χαφ[β]αρζαβᾶ καταρξάμενος, ἣ
νῦν Ἀντιπατρὶς καλεῖται, 850. “But Alexander, fearing his”
[Antiochus Dionysius] “ coming, digs a deep trench‚ begin—
ning at Capharzaba, which is now called Antipatris, unto the
sea of Joppa, a hundred and fifty furlongs.” Note, by the
way, from J oppa to Antipatris is a hundred and fifty furlongs,
that is, eighteen miles.

Wen will not contend about the name; of the situation of
it, as it stands almost in all maps, we doubt. We will give
the reason of our scruple by those things that folloxv3 in the
mean time we will give some history of the place.

I. Herod built it in memory of his father Antipater. Καὶῡ
γὰρ τῷ πατρὶ μνημεῖον κατέστησε, καὶ πόλιν, ἢν ἐν τῷ καλλίστῳ
τῆς βασιλείας πεδίῳ κτίσας, ποταμοῖς τε καὶ δένδρεσι πλουσίαν,
ὠνόμασεν Ἀντιπατρίδα; “ For he raised (saith J osephus) a mo-
nument to his father, and a city, which he built in the best
plain of his kingdom, rich in springs and woods, and called it
Antipatris.''

ΙΙ. Hither was Paul brought when he was carried to
Gaesarea, Acts xxiii. 31 ; where, unless those words, ἤγαγον
διὰ τῆς νυκτὸς εἰς τὴν Ἀντιπατρίδα, be rendered by no unusual
interpretation, ‘⁶ they brought him by night towards Anti-
