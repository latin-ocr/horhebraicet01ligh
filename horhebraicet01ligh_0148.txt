lightful cave in a mountain3 and under it the land hollowing
itself into a huge vale, full of standing waters. Over it a
great mountain hangs; and under the cave, rise the springs
of the river J ordan.''

And again, Παρὰο τὰς Ἰορδάνου πηγάς” καλεῖται δὲ Πάνιον ὁ
τόπος· ‘⁵ By the springs of Jordan: now the place is called
Panium.'’

And elsewhere P, Δοκεῖ μὲν Ἰορδάνου πηγὴ τὸ Πάνιον· “ Pa-
nium seems to be the fountain of Jordan :⁹⁹ and more may be
read there.

The Talmudists write thus-3 “ Rabhq saith, &37³⁸ ζἾἾἾ
ῦἾἾΥ-ἻΞ) ΠἿᾯὩὩ Jordan riseth out of the cave of Pamias: and
so is the tra(lition.''

ΒἯῺΞ νς cmlv “ R. Isaaor saith, Leslcem is Panum? The
Gloss is, ‘⁶ Leshem is a city which the Danites subdued
(J udg. xviii. 29): Pamias is a place whence Jordan ariseth.’'

And Pliny, “ TheS river of Jordan ariseth out of the foun-
tain Paneas.” Δ

Laish, or Leshem, which being subdued they called Dan, he
speaks thus3 Οἱ δ’ε οὐ πόρρω τοῦ Λιβάνου ὅρους καὶ ἐλάσσονοςἼ
Ἰορδάνου τῶν πηγῶν, &a “ But they, travelling a day’s journey
through the great plain of Sidon, not far from mount Libanus‚
and the springs of lesser Jordan, observe the land to bc good
and fruiffl'ul, and shew it unto their tribe ; who, invading it
with an army, build the city Dan.”

In like manner speaking of J eroboaln, he saith these
things3 “Heu built two temples for the golden calveS,—0ne
in Beth-el, ἕτερον δὲ ἐν Δάνῃ, ἥ δέ ἐστι πρὸς ταῖς πηγαῖς τοῦ
μικροῦ Ἰορδάνου; the other in Dan, which is at the springs of
little Jordan.''
