Jordan to that beyond, but those also of Samaria, and those
of the Lower Galilee, passed over here to Perea.

Here would I seek for Jacob's Bridge, where he passed
over “ Jordan with his staff,” when he went into Mesopo-
tamia, and returned back with a family; and not where it is
commonly now shewn. At least, the mention of Succoth,
Gen. xxxiii. 17, which had its situation on the bank of J or-
dan, exactly opposite to Zartanah, a town near Beth-shean‚
puts it out of all question that Jacob returned that way.
And, indeed, whether Scythopolis might not derive something

of its appellation from the word Suo-ooth [nizo] I cannot
well tell: methinks the name of ‘ Scythians' hath some smack
of such a kind of original, Σκύθαι, quasi Σύκκοθαι· for they

always dwelt, and removed from one place to another, in
tems.

NEITHER was this Beth-harah at any very great distance
from this passage. For so we have it, Judg. vii. 24: “Gi-
deon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, say-
ing, Come down against the Midianites, and take before
them the waters unto Beth-harah and Jordan.'' And this
they did.

It 0 is hard to say whether Kimchi with more reason said,
that “ these waters were not the waters of Jordan ;” or J ar-
chi, more absurdly, that “ they divided Syria from Canaan.”
There were, no doubt, some water-s in the valley of Jezreel :
for there the battle was,-—at least, if that may be called a
battle, where there was not one sword unsheathed by the
conqueror. See Judg. vi. 33.——When the Midianites fled,
Gideon summons the Ephraimites by messcngers, that they
would take those waters beforehand, which the routed enemy
in their ssight must necessarily pass through before they
could arrive at the bridgc or ferry over Jordan (spoken of
even now), that lay in their way home. When both armies
had pitched the field, the Midianites lay on the north, to-
wards Galilee, and the Gideonites on the south, near mount
Ephraim, chap. vii. 1. There was a river in the vale, (at
which waters, probably, Gideon distinguished betwixt his
sollowers, that lapped like a dog, and those that did not).
