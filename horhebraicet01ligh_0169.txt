temned Diclot the hog—herd3 we contemned not Diocletianus
the king.” Hence arose a suspicion among some learned
men, that this was not to be understood of Diocletian the
emperor, but of some little king, I know not whom, of a very
beggarly original: of which opinion I also was some time,

until at last Ι met with something that put the thing past
all doubt.

That you find in Avodah Zaraho. There inquiry is made

are related by the Talmudists.

These are all the places, unless Ι am much mistaken, where
this name occurs in this Talmud, one only excepted, which Ι
have reserved for this place, that, after we have discovered,
by these quotaffions, that this was Diocletian the emperor,
some years after him might be computed. That place is in
Sheviith: 0„an '2:117 ΡἾὟΝ ῠἾΞΝἺΔἾῖῒῬἾἻ “Diocletianus
