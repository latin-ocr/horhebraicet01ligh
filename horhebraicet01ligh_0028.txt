deed even with Arad, which is asserted in the text alleged,—
and if below these were En-gedi, which is also asserted by
the authors cited‚—certainly, then, the maps have laid it a
long way distant from its own proper place, too much north-
ward. View them, and think of these things. To which we
also add this :—

The southern borders of the land, Ezek. xlvii. ¹9 (the very
same which are mentioned Num. xxxiv. and Josh. xvi 2), are
thus declared3 “ The southern coast southward from Tamar
to the waters of Meribah in Cadesh? &a But now Tamar
and En-gedi are the same, 2 Chron. xx. 2. Nor have we any
reason why we should seek another Tamar elsewhere. Cer-
tainly, the Chaldee paraphrast‚ and Rabbi Sol. Jarchi, and
Kimchi following him, have rendered Tamar, in Ezekiel,
Jericlzo. But upon what reason? For how, Ι beseech you,
was it possible, that Jericho should be the bounds of the
south land, when it was the utmost bounds of Judea north-
ward? It was this, without all doubt, drove them to that
version of the word, because Jerz'clco is called the Oity of
Palma-and Tamar ἾΤῼᾹἾτ signifies a pedm,- since En-gedi
would not give place to Jerioho, one inch in regard of the
glory of palm-groves.

Whether Tadlnor, 1 Kings ix. 18, be the same with this
our Tamar,--and whether Tadmor in the Talmudists be the
same with that Tadmor,-—we leave to the reader to consider.
We produce these few things concerning it, which are ‘related
by them,—f0r the sake of such consideration :—

“ Theym receive proselytes from those of Cardya and Tad—
mor. Rab. Abhu, in the name of R.J0011anan, saith, The
tradition assertS, that the proselytos of Tadmor are fit to
enter into the congregati0n.'' It was said a little before;
“ Haggai the prophet taught these three Iessons ε-ΠΞΠ ΠἾΣ,
The rival of a daughter ⁷³ (of a priest) “ may be married by a
priest. The Moabites and Annnonites ought to tithe the
poor's tithe the sevcnth year. And the proselytes of Tadmor
are fit to enter into the congregation.’'

This story is recitcd in the Jerusalem Misnan: ΕἿἾὩ
