Bezetlm. Mallo. 55

The same author thus describes the burning of the Lower
City: Τό ‘res ἀρχεῖον, καὶ τὴν ”Ακραν, καὶ τὸ βουλευτήριον, καὶ
τὴν Ὀφλᾶν ὑφῆψαν· καὶ προῦκοψε τὸ πῦρ μέχρι τῆς Ἑλένης
βασιλείων, ἃ δὴ κατὰ μέσην τὴν ’Άκραν ἢν· “ Then they fired
the] Archivum and Aera, and the council-house, and Ophla:
and the fire destroyed unto the palaces of Helen, which were
in the middle of Acra.''

Ι. Ἀρχεῖον, the Archivum. Whether he means tlte ma-
ρίαν-αἰεί court, or the repository qf the ancient recorcls,
according to the different signification of the word, we do
not determine. There were certainly sacred records in the
Temple, and civil records no doubt in the city, where writ-
ings and memorials of sales, contmcts, donations, and public
acts, &a were laid up. I should more readily understand
this of their repository, than of the mayistratcs’ court,
because, presently after, the council-house is distinctly
named.

II. Aera .· that is, either the buildings, which were upon
the very head and top of the mount, or some garrison or
castle in the mount. In which sense that word doth not
seldom occur in the history of the Maccabees, and in
J osephus.

ΙΙΙ. The Oouncz‘Z-house. He mentions elsewhere βουλὴ the
coancil, and that, as it seems, in the Upper Gity. For he
saith, that “ thet outmost wall on the north began at the
Hippic tower, and went forward to the Xystus3 ἔπειτα τῇ
βουλῇ συνάπτον, and thence, touching upon tlm cozmcz'P' (or
the court), “it went onward oppositeu against the west wall<
of the Temple.’' The council in the Upper City you may not
improperly interpret the ‘Court of the King :³ the council-
house in the Lower city, the council of the Sanhedrim, whi-
ther it went, when it departed from the Tabernae.

IV. Ophla. ophel, Neh. iii. 26.

Therex was also a fourth hill, saith the same Josephus, ὃς
καλεῖται Βεζεθὰ, “ which was called Bezetha, situate over-
against Antonia, and dividcd from it with a deep ditch. Now
Bezetha, if you would render it in Greek, Καινὴ λέγοιτ’ ἂν
