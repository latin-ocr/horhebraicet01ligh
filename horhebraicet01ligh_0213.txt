did, but was swallowed up under the name of Arabia), then,
by way of distinction, it was called Ἰδουμαῖα Μεγάλη, “ Great
Idumeaf.'' [dumea the Lesa or the New, is that which we
are seeking, and concerning which St. Mark speaks, no small
part of J udea ;—so called either from its nearness to Idumea
properly so called, or because of the Idumeans that travelled
thither and possessed it, and that became proselytes to the
law and manners of the Jews. Such a one was Herod As-
calonita. When, therefore, it is said by the evangelist,
that “a great multitude followed Jesus from Galilee, and
from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea,'’ he
speaketh either of the Jews inhabiting that part of J udea,
which, at that time, was called Idumea,-—or at least of the
Idumeans, who inhabited it, being now translated into the
religion of the Jews. Concerning the country now con-
tained under that name, we shall speak by and by, following,
first, Pliny’s footsteps a little, from the place where he sets
out his progress,——na1nely, from Pelusium.

Smer. IL-A few clamys of Pelusium.

IN Ezek. xxx. 15, 16, ΓΕ) Sin, in the Vulgar interpreter
is ‘Pelusium :⁹ which the Latin interpreter of the Chaldee
paraphrast follows there: nor without good reason. For
ΓΞ Sin, and ΓΕ) Tm, among the Chaldees, is Mad. See the
Targum upon [sa. lvii. 21. And ‘ Pithom' and ⁴ Raamses'
(Exod. i. 11), in the Targnms of Jerusalem and J onathan,
are 3⁸²7le 0³:³0 T anis and Pelusium: thence those two gates
of Nile, t-he ‘ Tanitic' and the ⁶ Pelusiac,’ in Ptolemy and
the maps. But now, that country or place, which the Sy-
rians and Chaldeans call Sin, that is, Illudcly,-the Greeks
call Pelusium, from Πηλὸς, Mad. And who sees not that
Tanis is derived froin ΓΕ) Tin ,9

Andg here, for the sake of learners‚ let me observe‚ that
Pelusium is called in the Talmudists‚ ΝῬὮἾΞΡς which who
