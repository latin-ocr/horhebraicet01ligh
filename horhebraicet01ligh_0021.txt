are numbered with the Philistines‚ but yet by themselves,
J osh. xiii. 3 z——for see there, how the holy text promising to
number five nations only, numbers εἰῶ.

This excluded portion is passed into the name of Idumea.
Hence Plinyt: ‘⁶ Presently from the rising up of the lake Sir-
bon, begins Idumea and Palestine.'’ Nor that alone, but
another very great part of Judea. Hence the sea of Sodom,
is said, by Diodorus Siculus, to be κατὰιι μέσην Ἰδουμαίαν,
“ about the middle of Idu1nea.'' And in J osephus, and the
Book of the Maccabees, we find very many places mentioned
under the name of Idumea, which were almost in the very
middle of J udea. For example's sake 3 ἲΗλθιεν-ἳί μέχρι Γαδάρων,
καὶ τῶν πεδίων τῆς Ἰδουμαίας, καὶ Ἀζώτου, καὶ Ἰαμνείας· “ He
came even to the Gadari‚ and the plains of Idumea, and Azo-
tus, and .Janmia.” And again, ‘Oy δὲ Ἰούδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ
αὐτοῦ πολεμοῦντες τοῖς Ἰδουμαίοις οὐκ ἀνίεσαν· ἀλλ’ ἐνέκειντο
πανταχόθεν αὐτοῖς. τήν τε Χεβρῶνα πόλιν καταλαβόμενοι, 830.
καὶ Μάρισσαν πόλιν, ἕω. ε’ίς τε ’Ἄζωτον ἐλθόντες, ἕω. “ And
Judas and his brethren left not off fighting with the Idu-
means: but fell upon them everywhere: and taking the city
Ghebron, &a and the city Marissa, Sec. And having come
unto AzotuS,'’ &a And more to this purpose may be read
here and there. So that distinction may be made, between
Idumea the Greater and the Less. Simon of Gerasa [ταςΖ
ἀνὰ τὴν Ὀρεινὴν κώμας κατέτρεχεν, &Q κατέτρεχε δὲ τὴν Ἀκρα-
βατηνὴν, καὶ τὰ μέχρι τῆς μεγάλης Ἰδουμαίας] overran the towns
along the mountainous country, &c And he overran Acra-
batene, and the parts as far as Idumea the Great.” And there
is mention of τὴνᾶ ἄνω καλουμένην Ἰδουμαίαν, “ Idumea, called
the Upper.'' With these passages, compare Mark iii. 8.

Whilst the Jews were absent from their own country,
enduring the seventy years' bondage in Babylon‚-—it is easy
to be believed, that their ancient enemies, the Edomitcs, and
that were so from the very first original of them, had invaded
their possessions, as much as they could, and had fixed their
roots in that country especially, which was nearest their own:
