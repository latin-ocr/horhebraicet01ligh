time, as to allude to that miserable state of affairs they were
in under Antiochus. And perhaps it had been much more
for the reputation of the Christian commentators upon the
Book of the Revelations, if they had looked upon that number,
and the “ fort-y-and-two months,'’ and the “ thousand two
hundred and sixty dayS‚'' as spoken allusively‚ and not applied
it to any precise or determinate time.

By the way, whilst we are speaking of the persecution
under the Greeks, we cannot out call to mind the story in
the Second Book of Maecab. vii, of the mother and her
seven sons, that underwent so cruel a martyrdom: because
we meet with one very like it, if not the same, only the name
changed.

“ ‘Wel are killed all the day long, we are accounted as
sheep for the slaughter‚’ Psalm xliv. 22. Rab. Judah saith,

The story seems wholly tho same, only the names of An-
tiochus and Caesar changed; of which the reader, having
consulted both, may give his own judgment. And because
we are now fallen into a comparing of the story in the Mac-
cabeos with the TalmudistS, let us compare 0110 more in J ose-
plius with 0110 in the same authors.
