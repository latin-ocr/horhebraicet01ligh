ΠἮΠ “ Theym built a foot-causeway‚ or a foot-bridge‚ upheld
with arches, from the mount of the Temple to the mount of
Olives, upon which they led away the red cow (to be burned).
In like manner, such a foot-causeway they made, upon which
they led away the scape-goat : both were built at the charges
of the public treasure, which was in the Temple.'’ The reason
of that curiosity concerning the red cow was this 2- when the
ashes of that cow were especially purifying above all other
things (for they cleansed from the uncleanness contracted by
the touch of a dead person), they thought no cantion enough
to keep him safe fron] uncleanness, who was to burn the
cow. then, therefore, there might be, perhaps, some sepul· .
chres not seen, in the way he was to go, whereby he might
be defiled, and so the whole action be rendered useless,—
they made him a path, at no small cost, all the way, upon
arches joining to one another, where it was not possible to
touch a place of burial. The like care and curiosity was used
in leading away the scape-goat.

of the brook Kedron. The first day}J of the feast of the
Passover, certain persons, deputed from the Sanhedrim, went
forth into that valley, a great company attending them 3 and
very many out of the neighbouring towns flocked together,
that the thing might be done, a great multitude being pre-
sent. And the reason of the pomp was fetched thence,
because the Baithuseans, or SadduceeS, did not think well of
doing that action on that day: therefore, that they might
cross that crossing opinion, they performed the business with
as much show as could bc. “ When it was now even, he,
on whom the office of reaping laid, saith, ‘The sun is set 3'
and they answcred, ‘wells—‘The sun is set;q and they
answered‚ ⁶ Well. '—‘ With this rcaping-hook 3³ and they
