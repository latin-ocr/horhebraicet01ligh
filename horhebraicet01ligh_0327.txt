Emmaus. Timnatlc. Movent Gilead. 317

places named along with it, in what quarter of the heaven
it was situated. To all which we may add that of J osephus‚
Antiq. lib. xii. cap. 11. [xii. 7. 4.] and 1 Maec. iv: Judas
Maccabeus engages with Gorgias near Emmaus: the Gor-
gians fly, and the Maccabeans pursue, μέχρι Γαδάρων, καὶ τῶν
πεδίων τῆς Ἰδουμαίας, καὶ Ἀζώτου, καὶ Ἰαμνείας, “ as far as
Gadaron (Gezer) to the plains of Idumea, Azotus, and J am-
nia.”

I therefore recite this passage, that it may appear that
Emmaus lay towards Galilee, although from Jerusalem it in-
clined also westward. For whereas, concerning the latitudo
of Galilee extending itself from west to east, there must of
necessity be several roads from Jerusalem to this or that part
of it; so this through Emmaus was one, through Beth-horon
another, through Antipatris a third; if, at least, this last
did not fall in with that of Emmaus. That passage in Gul.
Tyriqu makes me think it might; who, describing the en-
campings and journeyings of the crusade ariny, tells us,
“ Leaving the maritime towns, Antipatris and J oppa on the
right, they passed through Eleutheria, and came to Lydda,
which is Diospolis.” And cap. 24, “ From whence, taking
guides along with them, persons well skilled in those places,
they came to Nicopolis :'’ which is the same with Emmaus.

From all which we may reasonably presume that the two
disciples were going to Emmaus, not as to the utmost limit
of their jcurney, but as that lay in their way towards Galilee.

Suc-T. III.—Some story of it. Also of Timnatlz ancl
mount Gileacl, Judg. vii. 3.

To what tribe Emmaus belonged would be something
hard to determine, because of the situation of Beth-horon,
which was in Ephraim, Jos11.xvi; but that the Talmudists
do clearly enough say, it was not in the Samaritan country.

“ Theyc were servants of the priests, saith R. Meir. But
R. J ose saith, They were of the family of Beth Pegarim, and
Beth Zippory, in Emmaus, who had placed their daughters iu
marriage with the p1·iestS.''
