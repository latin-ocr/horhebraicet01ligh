Mac-lacerus, α castle. 347

τοῦ. “ He fortified a castle upon a hill towards Arabia, and
called it Herodium‚ after himself. ” VVhere, by Arabia,
you are to understand the land of λίοαός and he seemed
to have fortified that castle, as a bulwark against the Moab-
itish Arabs.

The same Herod that built it is buried there, as the same
Josephus tells ush3 where, describing the funeral pomp, he
gives this account: Πευτακόσιοι δὲ ὑπ’ αὐτοῖς τῶν οἰκετῶν καὶ
ἀπελευθέρων ἀρωματοφόροι, “ After those followed five hundred
of ln's own domestic servants, bearinq spiees. Σταδίους δὲ
ἐκομίσθη τὸ σῶμα διακοσίους εἰς Ἱ-Ιρώδιου, ὅπου κατὰ τὰς ἐντολὰς
ἐτάφη· His body was bronqht two hundred fnrlonys'’ [from
Jericho where he died] to Her-odium, where, accordiny to
his own appoiomnem, loe was interred. But, in Antiq. lib.
xvii. cap. 101, ''Haeo-av δὲ ἐπὶ Ἡρωδίου στάδια ὀκτώ· “ They
came to Herodintn eri-qm fnrlonys‚· for there he had ordered
his funeral solemnities.'' At first sight, here is an appearance
of a slip in history: but it is to be understood, that from
J ericho to Heredium it was two hundred furlongs, that is,
twenty-five miles3 but Herod's burying-place was eight fur-
longs from Hemdium, a common distance for burying-places
to be from cities.

J osnpnus¹ tells us, that John Baptist was imprisoned by
Herod in the castle of Machaerus: Καὶ ὁ μὲν, ὑποψίᾳ τῇ Ἡρώ-
δου, δέσμιος εἷς τὴν Μαχαιροῦντα πεμφθεὶς, &a “ He [the Bap-
tist]‚ upon Herod's suspicion, is sent prisoner to Machaerus.”
A little before that he had told us, μεθόριοι) δέ ἐστι τῆς τε
Ἀρέτα, καὶ Ἡρώδου ἀρχῆς· This place “ is the frontier betwixt
the kingdom of Aretas [tlte Arabian lcingy] and Herod.''

Of the situation of the place, Plinym hath this him-,3
“ Prospicit [Asphaltitin] ab oriente Arabia Nomadum [1110αό-
itis]: a meridie Machaerus, secunda quondam Arx Judaeae
ab Hierosolymis.'' The meaning of which is this; “that
Arabia of the Nomades [or Moab] situated on the east of
