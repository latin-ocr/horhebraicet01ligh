tine3 and, while I think upon it, Ι doubt again of the division
of Palestine into two parts in the code of Justinian and
Theodosius; and into three parts in the N otitia.

Int the edict of Theodosius and Valentinian are these
words; “ J udaeorum PrimateS, qui in utriusque Palaestinae
Synhedriis dominantur, vel in aliis provinciis degunt, periculo
suo anniversarium canonem de synagogis omnibus, Palatinis
compellentibus, exigant ad eam formam, quam patriarchae
quondam, coronarii auri nomine, postulabant,'’ &a “The
chief of the Jews, who were over the Sanhedrims in both
Palestines‚ or live in other provinces‚’' Sco.

The mention of ‘ both Palestines' seems plainly to exclude
a threefold division; or at least to conclude, that there were
no Sanhedrims in the third part. For without all scruple, the
‘ Notitia Imperii’ gives us a ⁶ third part‚' in which are ranked,
‘⁶ Under the disposition of the worthy man, the Earl of the
Bast, these provinces underwritten:

Palestine.

Phoenice.

Syria.

Cyprus.

Palestine the second υ.
Palestine the Healthful.
Phoenice of Libanus.’'

And Justinianx hath these words; ‘¹ W hen all Palestine
formerly was one, it was afterward divided into three parts.”

The head of the first the same emperor assigns to be
Oaesarea; Gulielmus Tyriusy to be Jerusalem : and concern-

ing the second and third, he and Pancirolus do not agree. ,

For the metropolis of the second, according to Tyrius, is
Gaesarea,—and Scythopolis of the third :—according to Pan-
cirolus, Samaria is the metropolis of the second—and Jeru-
salem of the third.

On the credit of Justinian, you may with good reason sup-
pose the first to be that, whose head is Caesarea; the second,
reason itself will persuade us to have been that of J erusalem;
and where you will go to seek the third, Ι, for my part,
