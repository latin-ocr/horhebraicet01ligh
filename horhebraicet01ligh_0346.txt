ὄρος καὶ τὸν ποταμὸν τοῦ μήκους ποιησαμένῃ τέρμονα, τὸ δ’ Ἰτα-
βύριου ὅρος τοῦ πλάτους· i. e. “ Next to Manasseh is Issachar,
having for its boupds of longitude mount Carmel and the
river [Jordan]‚ and of latitude mount Tabor.'' That is, the
latitude of Issachar is from Manasseh to mount Tabor‚ as
J osephus plainly makes out in that place. Mount Tabor‚
therefore, lay as it were in the midst, betwixt the coasts of
Samaria and Upper Galilee: having on this side Issachar
towards Samaria, and on that side Zabulon towards the
aforesaid Galilee.

Josephusy describes mount Tabor‚ where these things
seem something obscure ; τὸ Ἰταβύριον ὅρος, ὅ ἐστι τοῦ μεγάλου
πεδίου καὶ Σκυθοπόλεως μέσον. We have already seen where
Scythopolis lay 3 and where the μέγα πεδίου, the preat plain,
near Scythopolis, But what should that μέγα πεδίον, yreat
plain be, that lieth so behind Tabor towards the north, that
Tabor should be betwixt it and Scythopolis? Is not Zabulon
so called in Josephus3 yea, and Issachar too, at least a
great part of it,'if we consult the same J osephus Ζ. So that
the μέγα πεδίου of Scythopolis or Manasseh, is distinctly
called by him μέγα πεδίου Σαμαρείτιδος, “ the great· plain of
Samaria ³3² ’

And the Lower Galilee is described by the Talmudists
by this character, ‘⁶ That it produceth sycamines, which the
Upper Galilee doth not b.’' Now the sycamine trees were ἐν
τῇ πεδινῇ, in tlte vale, 1 Kings x. 27. And hence seems to
arise the distinction between c the Upper and the Lower Gra-
lilee3 the Lower so called because more plain and champaign,
the Upper because more hilly and mountainous

I am deceived if the Upper Galilee be not sometimes by
way of emphasis called ‘ Galilee ς’ nor without cause, when as
the Lower might be called μέγα πεδίου, or the yreat plain.
So Cana had the adjunct of ‘ Cana of Galilee,' perhaps that
it might (listinguish that Cana which bounds both the Gali-
lees; of which more in its proper place. That passage which
we meet with in our evangelist, chap. iv. 43, 44, “ Hc de-
partcd from thence [smm Samaria] and went into Galilee;
