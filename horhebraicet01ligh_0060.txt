lee parts of the Oity. Sion. ’Άνω πόλις, the Upper Oity:
which was on the north part.

THERE is one who asserts Jerusalem to stand on seven
hi11s; but whether upon a reason more light, or more obscure,
is not easy to say. “ The whale showed J onah (saith he y)
the Temple of the Lord, as it is said, ‘I went down to the
bottom of the mountainsz' whence we learn that Jerusalem
was seated upon seven mountains.'' One may sooner almost
prove the thing itself, than approve of his argument. Let
him enjoy his argument to himself ; we must fetch the situa-
tion elsewhere.

ΠόλιςΖ μὲν ὑπὲρ δύο λόφων ἀντιπρόσωπος ἔκτιστο. “ The city
itselfa (saith J osephus) was built upon two hills, divided with
a valley between, whemby, in an opposite aspect, it viewed
itself 3 in which valley the buildings, meeting, ended.''

Τῶν δὲ λόφων, ὁ μὲν τὴν ἄνω πόλιν ἔχων, ὃῦο. “ Of these
hills, that, which contained the Upper City was by far the
higher, and more stretched out in length: and because it
was very well fortified, it was called by king David The
Oastle: ἡ δὲ ἅνω ἀγορὰ πρὸς ἡμῶν, but by us it is called ‘ the
Upper Town.' ’²

‘'Arepos δὲ, ὁ καλούμενος ”Ακρα, καὶ τὴν κάτω ’πόλιν ὑφεστὼς,
Suc. ‘⁶ But the other, which was called Aera, bearing on it
the lower town, was steep on both sides.'''

“ Against this was a third hill [lllort'ach lower than Aera,
and disjoined from it by a broad valley. But when the As-
moneans reigned, they filled up the valley, desiring that tho
Temple might touch the city3 and they took the top of Aera
lower, that the Temple might overlook it.”

Bezetha and Ophel were other little hills also: of which
in their place, when we shall first have taken a view of these
two, Sion and Aera, and the situation of each.

It is an old disputo, and lasts to this day, whether Sion or
Jerusalem lay on the north part of the city. We place Sion
on the north, convinccd by those reasons :—
