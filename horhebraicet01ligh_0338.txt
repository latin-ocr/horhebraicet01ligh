328 Choroyraphical inquiry.

Norc indeed is it much wonder, that Bethamara should
change into Bethania, since Bethamara being writ 3⁸5³:
wamy, signifies a place of wool,· and Bethania, being writ
&³¹22sz 17³2, signifies a place of sheep.

But it seems very strange how Bethabara should ever
change into Bethany, unless upon some such occasion as
these:

Either that Bethabara might be taken for the same with
ΠἾΞΠ ΠἮ, i. e. the house of omposition, or the school (in which
sense we meet with ΝἫἾΞ and ΝΠ”ἾΞ); whence for expli-
cation it is annexed‚ by some hand or other in the margin d,
ΝὊΠ fv: the house of tradition, or doctrine .· as if the evan-
gelist were to be understood in this manner3 “ These things
were done or disputed in a certain school beyond Jordan,
where John was baptizing.’' And so that worde ΝὊΠ FF:
being so very known and obnoxious, might steal from the
margin into the text and common use.

Or perhaps, secondly, upon the suspicion of a tautology‚ if
Bethabara and Πέραυ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου should be found together,
ἶἾἾἾΠ Ἒῃ ΠἾᾏὩ ΠἮε because ³5:137 rw: may be looked
upon as the same thing with “ a place beyond Jordan :'’
therefore, they might substitute the word Bethany as sig-
nisying ‘ Batanea' οι· ‘ Bashan' to some such sense as this3
“These things were done in Batanea beyond Jordan,⁷’ διο.
But it is our province at present to inquire rather into the
situation of Bethabara, than into the original and deriva-
tion of Bethany.

SECT. IL—The noted passa-eyes orer Jordan.

AMONG the various ways of writing Βηθαβαρᾶ in Hebrew‚
these two especially deserve our consideration at present :
‘Beth-barah,' which we meet with in Judg. vii„ and Beth-
abara, or a place ofpassaye, where they passed over Jordan.
They must both come under our inquiry‚ whiles we are seeking
the place in hand ; and, first, of the latter.

Doubtless there was no part of Jordan but might be passed
by boat from one side to the other, as lnen's different occa-
sions might call them; but we are now considering the public
