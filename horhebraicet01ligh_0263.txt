The reyz'ooz qf Decapolis. 25ss

famed cities of Galilee for cities of Decapolis, when, both in
sacred and profane authors, Galilee is plainly distinguished
from Decapolis. ln Pliny, it seems an unequal match to
join Damascus and philadelphia, formerly the two metropoles
of Syria and the kingdom of Ammon, with the small cities os
Gadara and Hippo.

With Pliny and his followers J osephus also consents, in
reckoning up some cities of Decapolis. For severely chiding
J ustus of Tiberias, he has these words: Σὺ καὶ πάντες Τιβε-
ριεῖς, οὐ μόνον ἀνειλήφατε τὰ ὅπλα, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς ἐν τῇ Συρίᾳ
Δέκα πόλεις ἐπολεμεῖτε· “ Your also and all the men of Tibe-
rias have not only taken up arms, but have fought against
the cities ofDecapolis in Syria.'' Observe that: The cities
of Decapolis ἐν Συρίᾳ, in Syria, not in Galilee. Σὺ γοῦν τὰς
κώμας αὐτῶν ἐνέπρησας· “ Thou hast set their cities on fire.’'
And a little after, “ After that Vespasian was come to Pto-
lemais, οἱ πρῶτοι τῶν τῆς Συρίας Δέκα πόλεων, the chief men of
Decapolis of Syria sharply accused Justus of Tiberias, ὅτι
τὰς κῶμας αὐτῶν ἐνέπρησεν, that lae had flred their towns.”
But what those towns of Decapolis werez. he hints elsewhere
in these words: “Thena Justus persuading his fellow-citi-
zens to take arms, and compelling those that would not, and
going forth with all these, ἐμπίμπρησι τάς τε Γαδαρηνῶν καὶ
Ἱππηνῶν κώμας, heb ,ἡνω- tlae villayes of the Gadarenes and the
Hippens.'’

You see how, with Pliny, Josephus joins the region of
Decapolis to the side of Syria, and how he reckons Gadara
and Hippo for Decapolitan towns with him. And yet, as we
said, Pliny doth not please us in all: but that which in him
might seem most ridiculous and absurd, namely, that he
reckons Scythopolis, which is beyond Jordan, with the other
cities pleaseth me most of all. For from that very city we
are certified what were the other cities, and why they were
of such singular name and note: having first taken notice of
the condition of Scythopolis, it will be more easy to judge of

the rest.
