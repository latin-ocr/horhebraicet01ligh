When you take a view of that famous fountain, as it is
described by Josephus, thence you understand what waters
of Jericho the Holy Ghost points 0111 111 Josh. xvi. 1.—And
when you think of that most pleasant country watered from
thence, let that Rabbinical story come into your mind, of
ἹΠἿἾἾ ³712> ἾΞἪἾἾ lee yzfl of Jerich0‚ of five hundred cubits
square, granted to the sons of Hobab‚ Moses’s father-in-law:
of which see Baal Turim, upon Num. x. 29, and the Rabbins

Jericlzo itself.

WE read, that this city was not only wasted by J oshua ,

with fire and sword, but cursed also. ‘⁶ Gursed be he before
the Lord, who shall rise up and build that city J ericho‚” J osh.
vi. 26. “ Nor was another city to be built (says the Tal-
mudists y), which was to be called by the name of J ericho:
nor was Jericho itself 10 be built, although to be called by
another name.'' And yet Ι know not by what chance this
city crept out of dust and rubbish, lived again, and fiourished,
and became the second city to Jerusalem. The same per-
sons which were just now cited, suppose that the restorer of
it was Hiel, the son of Jehoshaphat, to wit, the same with
J echiel, 2 Chron. xxi. 2 ; ‘⁶ Hiel (say they z) was of «101105113-
phat, and J ericho of Benjamin.'' And that is a just scruple,
which R. Davida objects,—how it came about, that the pious
king Jehoshaphat should suffer such a horrid thing to be
done within his kingdom? Much more, how this should have
been done by his son? Let thern disputo 1110 1)ι15111055; we
hasten somewhere else.

That, which ought not to be done,—being once done,
stands good. Iliel did a cursed thing in building Jericho:
yet Jericho was not 1ο be cursed‚ bcing now built. A little
after its restoration, it was made noble by the schools of the
prophetS, 2 Kings ii. 53 and it flourished with the rest of
the cities of Judea unto tho destruction of the nation by the
Babylonians.
