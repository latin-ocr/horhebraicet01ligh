beginning: “ He¹ that brings a bill of divorce from a heathen
country is bound to witness thus,—This bill was written I
being present, and was sealed Ι being present. R. Eleazar
saith, Yea, he that brings it from Caphar Lodim to Lydda :”
R. Nissim, explaining the place, saith thus ς “ Caphar Lodim
was without the land of Israel, neighbour to Lydda, which
was within [the land} and partook of its name, because some
people of Lydda were always present there.''

east of it. ‘⁶ R. Eleazar ¹¹ had a vineyard of four years'

near Caphar Tebi.” Of it there is this mention also :—-

“ TheyO sometime brought a chest full of bones from
Caphar Tebi, and they placed it openly in the entrance to
Lydda. Tudrus the physician and the rest of the physicians
go forth'’-——(namely, that they might judge, whether they
were the bones of men or no; and thereby, whether they
were to be esteemed clean or unclean). “ Tudrus said, Here
is neither the backbone nor the skull of a man. They said,
therefore, Since here are some, who reckon them clean, others
that hold them unclean, let the matter be decided by votes.
R. Akibah began, and he pronounced them clean, &0.”

The name ’212 Tebi, given to this village, seems to be de-
rived from the kicls [⁸23⁷ Heb.] skipping up and down in
this fruitful vale. The word also gave name to men ; and that,
as it seems, with some delight. The woman Tabitha [Ταβιθὰ
ἡ διερμηνευομένη λέγεται Δορκάς] is of eternal memory, Acts
ix. [36]; and, in the pages of the Talmudists, “ Tobip the
servant of Rabban Gamaliel3 and Tabithaq his 111aid-se1·vant.
Yea, every maid-servant of his was called, NN'QD NON,
Mother Tabitha,——an‹l every man-servant, 'nm &224 Father
Tebi.”
