BETWEEN Lydda and the sea, a spacious valley runs out,
here and there widely spreading itseff, and sprinkled with
villages. The holy page of the New Testament [Acts ix, 3 5.]
calls it Saron, τὸν Σάρωυα; and that of the Old calls the whole,

The wine of Sharon is of great fame, withh which they

that builds a brick house in Sharon, let him not return
back :³⁹ which was allowed to others, Deut. xx, 5‚-namely‚

a new house, and it were not yet dedicated. “ But k the men
of Sharon withdrew not themselves baok'' (they are the words
of the Jerusalem Gamam), “ because they repaired their
houses within seven years: and the chief priest also prayed
for them on the day of expiation, that their house might not
become their graves.’' The Gloss upon the Babylonian Tal-
mud thus3 ‘⁶ Sharon was the name of a place, whose ground
was not fit for bricks: and therefore, they often repaircd
their houses within seven years.”

Among the villageS‚ scattered up and down in this pleasant
vale, we meet with Caphar Lodim, between Lydda and the
sea. There is mention of it m the book Gittin‚ in the very
