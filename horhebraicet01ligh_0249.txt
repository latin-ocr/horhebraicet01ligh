pretation. But the Arabic of Erpenius’s edition reads Dal-
manutlza.—“ Erasmus notes (saith Beza upon the place),
that a certain Greek copy hath Maqdala. And Austin
writes, that most copies have Maqeda. But in our very old
copy, and in another besides, for εἷς τὰ μέρη Δαλμανουθὰ, ‘into
the parts of Dalmamctlaa, is written εἰς τὰ ὅρια Μαὸεγαὸὰ,
‘ into the coasts of Macleqada?

If the name and situation of Maydala in the Talmudists
had been known to these interpreters, Ι scarcely think they
would have dashed upon so many uncertaiutieS. We have
largely and plainly treated of it in another volume, out of
those authors: and out of the same, unless Ι mistake‚ some-
thing may be fetehed, which may afford light to Mark’s text
of Dalmanutha. Which thing before we take in hand,
perhaps it will not be unacceptable to the reader, if we de-
scribe the sea of Gennemret, and the places adj0ining, by
some kind of dehueation, according to their situation, which
we take up from the Hebrew writers.

places adjacent.

COMPARlNG this my little map with others, since you see it
to differ so much from them, you will expect that Ι sufficiently
prove and illustrate the situation of the places, or Ι shall come
off with shame. Ι did that, if my opinion deceive me not, a
good while ago, in some chapters in the Chorographical cen-
tury. I will here despatch the sum total in a few lines :

I. “ Chammath was so called Y, because of the war-m baths
of Tiberias : from which it was so very little distant, that, as to
a sabbath-day's journey‚ the men of Tiberias and the men of
Chaminath might make but one city.qq

It is called ³7: &rim-1 Chammatlz of Gadara, not only
to distinguish it from 37³7& ΠὮΠ ΟΙιαηῑφηατΙι of Pella, that
is, ⁶ Callirrhoe ;' but because a part of it was built upon the
bank of Gadara, and another part upon the bank of Neph-

thali, or Tiberias, the bridge lying between: which shall be
shewn presently.
