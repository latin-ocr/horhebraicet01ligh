The pool Shelahlc. 365

Now, therefore, here arisoth a question, whether that pool
be the pool of Siloam or no: which as yet hath hardly been
questionedc by any, and, for some time, not by myself. But
Iam now apt- to think that it was so distinguished botwixt
tho two pools, that the lower pool retaining its name of the
‘ Pool of Shelahh,’ the upper pool obtained that of ‘ Siloa,th

For,

Ι. How otherwise should that distinction of the Greek
version arise, but that tho interpreters followed the common
pronunciation of the word Shelahh, when they render it τῶν
κωδίων, of skins.

Il. Those words of St. John ix. 7, Εἰς τὴν κολυμβήθραν τοῦ
Σιλωὰμ, ὃ ἑρμηνεύεται Ἀπεσταλμένος, “ in the pool Of Siloam,
which is by interpretation, Sent,'‘ seem to intimate that there
were two pools of a very near sound‚ whereof one signified
Ἀπεσταλμένος, Sent, the other not.

Ill. The Jerusalem Talmudists seem to say that the upper
pool was called the ‘Pool of Siloam' in these words : “ He d
that is unclean by a dead body doth not enter into the mount
of the Temple. Itis said that they appeal only in the cour.t

was in the midst of the city?

The question here propounded is, whether he that is un-
clean by a dead body may be permitted to enter the Temple:
and the stating of it comes to this, that inquiry bo mado
within what measure he is to be admitted3 whether within
the wall of the Temple, or at that distance where tho houses
next to the Templo end; especially where the houses of Si-
loam end.

Now, whereas they say mrum-s mmm rnrx trihu> mat
»Siloam is in the midst of tlte city, it must by no means be un-
derstood of the sountain itself, for that was plainly without
the city ; nor yet os the lower pool Shelahh, for that also was
without tho city, or scarce within it. There is, therefore, no
third, unless that this upper pool bo called ‘ tho pool ossi-
loain,' and that it give (lenomination to tho adjacent part of
tho city, to wit, to the five porches and tho buildings about
it: which though thoy wore not in tho very centro of tho city,
