Eylatlc ›thelz'slziy'alc. 351

Jer. xlviii. 34: ³3³2?th n‘yay muniri-7:57 wisi-2⁵2 ‘‹ from
Zoar to Horonaim, a heifer of three years old.”

Vulgar; “ Α Segor usque ad Horonaim, vitula conter-
nante θ’ “ From Segor unto Horonaim‚ the heifer being in
her third year?q And so others.

I am not ignorant what commentatore say upon these
places: but why may not U21235³37125 Πῖῖλᾩ Eylath Skolislzqssy‘alc be
the name of some place, and ‘so ca'lled a third hyla& in
respect of two other places much of the same sound; or
duckess, or noble Eylalz, as ἱζῇἾίἊζ] signifies a (lake or tri-
hune.

There is mention of ῦἾῖῖλζ] Γᾩ Ein Eylaz‘m, in that country,
Ezek. xlvii. ¹03 where Eylaim is plainly of the dual number,
and seems to intimate that there were two Eyels, with relation
to which this our Eylak may be called quah me third. So
Ramathaim, 1 Sam. i. 2, is of the dual number, and plainly
shews there were two Ramahs.

The sound of the word Necla comes pretty near it. This
we meet with in Ptolemy, in Arabia Petraea:

Ζώαρα, Zoar . 67. 20. 30. 30.
Θοάνα, Thoan . 67. 30. 30. 30.
Νέκλα, Necla . 67. 20. 30. ¹5·

Sos that here we see the geographer mentions Zoar and
Neela, as the prophet before had Zoar and Eglah: and how
easily might Eglah pass into Necla 111 Greek writing, espe-
cially if the letter 37 hath any thing of the sound of the letter
η 111 it.. The geographer makes the distance of Zoar from
Necla to be fifteen miles: so, we may suppose, was the dis-
tance of Zoar from Eglah, Horonaim lying between them;
from whence the words of the prophet may not be unfitly
rendered thus : ,

“ His fugitives shall fiee unto Zoar, unto the third Eglah.

From Zoar unto Horonaim: even unto the third Eglal1.'’

I am deceived 11“”Αγαλλα, Agalla, which we meet with in
J osephus ⁵, be not the Eglah we are now speaking of: 1111111-
bering up the twelve cities, which Hyrcanus promised hc
would restore to Aretas, the Arabian king, being what his
father Alexander had taken from him: among-st the rest 11(ι
